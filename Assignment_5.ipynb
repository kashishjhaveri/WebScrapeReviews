And of course, we would go out. The next door neighbors would go out. The front door neighbors would go out, just to let them know that we're watching them. But the thing is that I told my husband, \"We go outside, we don't know they're gonna have a gun, they're gonna shoot us.\"My home has been in this neighborhood for close to 100 years. I was literally born in this home. I'll be 66 this year. We could be with our doors open.

But the thing is that I told my husband, \"We go outside, we don't know they're gonna have a gun, they're gonna shoot us.\"I just finished calling the officers right now. And I said, \"There's two guys walking down the street. There's a lot of activity going on. They're passing by with compressors or weed eaters.\" So, one is looking on one side, the other one is looking at the other side. And they're hoping to see what they will hit or when they will hit or what they will do. It just doesn't feel good. That is when I said, \"That's it.\"I noticed a couple of things missing. The side from the front and the front from the front towards where the house again are wide open. I have privacy fence all the way to the back. And then on the other side, my nextdoor neighbor has a chainlink. So, I've never felt like I needed a fence because I could be sitting here with my doors open. I felt safe. But now, I don't. So, every time I left the house, I was worried.My daughter was telling me, \"Why don't you do the cameras, mom, like that you can take a pic?\" I said, \"Well, I can barely afford this.\" She said, \"Mom, they have specials. Just call them. Maybe they can help you to set you up with a camera.\" Because it so happened that my front door neighbor, somebody passed. There's a lot of activity going on that we never had before. They broke her window from the passenger side and the passenger side window and the mirror. They passed by, and they hit it with a BB gun. I said, \"If I had a camera, we would have gotten the vehicle and everything.\" This is all new to me. I'm not used to this. We always had little things happen, but we all keep an eye on each other. If anything, I would have to buy a camera and install Brinks or whatever that you just put them on yourself and be on the phone and look at what is going on.I was sitting outside and I kept seeing people passing by and then you could tell they're on all those drugs and stuff. So, I said no. That's when I saw Protect My Home's Ad on Facebook and I called. I know they're top-of-the-line. And then, it so happened that it was perfect timing because there was a special because of COVID. It was godsent. I'm really satisfied with the gentleman's explanation who came with the installing. It took me a bit to get to understand it, but I'm almost where I need to be as far as disarming, arming, and staying. Customer service have been very patient and very detailed. So, I really appreciate that.The only thing that happened was, a couple of days ago, I was trying to get something from the top of the refrigerator. We're seniors, and my hands are weak. I have a fractured rib that has been a permanent thing. So, when I was going to grab that thing, it fell, and the little casing fell off, and the alarm went off. Of course, I came and disarmed it right away, and I called in. They were able to walk me except that I said, \"You know what, I don't know if this is gonna work. I have to get up the ladder to climb to take off the battery, restart it. And then I didn't know how to put the lid back on.\" I have to go up and down the ladder because the alarm would go off. But we've been it long time. I live in Bath. As far as customer service, right away. I'm very satisfied with everything except that.My daughters all have the systems as well. I said, it's not something that we can really afford but it's something that I feel that we need. It's more a necessity than a luxury because of the situation that's going on right now. Even though we're all neighbors, but sometimes some of us wanna travel and I go to the store and we go and work, like, \"Okay, is somebody going to break in?\" The system gives me peace of mind.\n"

      "I've seen ADT signs around and when the salesperson called, he said they would give me all these credits for the equipment. When he got here, I told him what I wanted then he told me I would have to make these huge payments until it was paid for. I figured I would pay for the equipment throughout my three years, but that was not how it worked. I had to have it paid for within four months and I wasn't told that. My monthly installments would've been $600 and that was not going to work. Once the installer got done, he talked about how much I had to pay over so many months, but I thought it would be over the term of my contract. I just purchased a new place, and $2,000 was not an option at that moment.I've seen ADT signs around and when the salesperson called, he said they would give me all these credits for the equipment.

I just purchased a new place, and $2,000 was not an option at that moment.I ended up paying the 100 something to get the system in the house, but I felt misled on that situation by the salesperson at the beginning. Still, the installer was great. He was on point and helped me out as much as he could to get what I've gotten. I like the system, but I would definitely have liked to add some more things to it without a big blimp payment to do it. However, if that's the way it works, then there's nothing I can do about it. Also, I have the app downloaded to my phone, which is nice. I can set the alarm and deactivate it when I get home. When I would set my alarm off, they would call me and they are very responsive. When they call though, they need to ask for a passcode and if you give them the wrong one, they need to send the cops.When I got home one day, I went in my garage and I set the alarm off. Once I figured out that my alarm was going off, I ran up to the house and deactivated it with my main controller. Someone from the company called me, but it was a little funny how that worked. She said I deactivated the alarm by my main controller and asked if everything was okay. I told her what had happened, then she said okay and that was it. I wasn't even asked to give a passcode. What if somebody was standing here with a gun to my head? Of course, I'm going to tell them everything was okay, but if something was going on, there should be a word or a phrase that alerts them without alerting the thief or whoever it is that the cops are on their way.\n",

      "I was thinking about what I can do to improve the security and I started calling, trying to find a company that we have used in the past. I ended up calling Protect Your Home and the lady I spoke with told me the cost. It was very low. She also said, \"You don't have to pay the equipment.\" We ended up setting up the appointment, then the technicians came. They were very nice and very professional. They were not wearing masks, but that's okay.I was thinking about what I can do to improve the security and I started calling, trying to find a company that we have used in the past. I ended up calling Protect Your Home and the lady I spoke with told me the cost. It was very low. She also said, \"You don't have to pay the equipment.\" We ended up setting up the appointment, then the technicians came. They were very nice and very professional. They were not wearing masks, but that's okay.They gave me an estimate of what it will cost me and it was completely different to what the lady on the phone has given me when I called the first time to ADT. But then, they listened to what I had to say about why I couldn't pay the amount that they had on that. They accommodated the price according to my necessity and they sold the business. So, so far, I'm doing fine. The only problem that I'm having right now is when we have thunderstorms and lightning, sometimes the windows will vibrate, so the alarm goes off and I have to run. Other than that, I don't have a problem and I have received some correspondence for $100 credit card that the company's giving us. I have to go and find a money order, buy the money order, and send the $4.95, so I can get that amount of money. The two gentlemen that came were very professional. They are out to sell their product. Unfortunately, sometimes, consumers don't have the money to pay what is there that they are selling. But they gave me what I needed. It was about $400 more than the initial that the lady has given me, but that is perfectly fine. When we call the company, the person on the phone could say, \"You know what, this is the minimum price that we have.” Then they will assess the risk. They will look at your house and your needs, and the price may vary to prepare the person on the other side. It's not the same when you say, \"Oh, it's $850 and this and that.\" And then when they come and put in front of you a document with $6,000 plus. I'm like, \"Wait a second. You know what, I'm not rich. I'm looking for safety for the humans in the house, not because of the TVs and the things that I have, because they can be replaced.\"My idea looking to reinstall an alarm in the house is because of my husband's passing. The people in the house need to be protected somehow. So I said, \"Well, maybe the alarm is a great idea.\" I have a camera right inside the house, I have the ring on the door, but an alarm would be better because somebody will be monitoring while I go to sleep tired after a long day of work. The people that came accommodated my needs and they sold the product. I really appreciate the fact that they listened and that they were paying attention to what I was saying. It was not like, \"What are we doing here? This woman doesn't have the money.\" They were able to help.\n",

      "I used to use Moni Electronic and Protect Your Home is working better. I also had Protect Your Home a few years ago, which was one reason why I went back.  Online, they had a lot to offer and it seemed like a pretty good company. The two ladies I talked to were really nice, but I was not happy with the person who installed the system. I have two doors in my garage, one goes into my washroom, one goes into my dining room. When I pull my Corvette in and open my door, I got a door right there and I can go right into my house with my dining room and kitchen. It's kinda together. I wanted my pad in-between the doorway going in my kitchen and going into my dining room. My fiance was there and told the installer that, but he drilled a hole dead center on an eight-foot wall and put the keypad in so that I couldn't put my China cabinet.I used to use Moni Electronic and Protect Your Home is working better.

My fiance was there and told the installer that, but he drilled a hole dead center on an eight-foot wall and put the keypad in so that I couldn't put my China cabinet.When I got to ask him why he did that, he said that was the easiest spot to get to. I said that my China cabinet was going there. Why would you put it dead center on an eight-foot wall? He could've put it closer to the door. Now, I got a two quarter-inch hole in the middle of my wall and I just got finished redoing that room. Now, I gotta do a patch and repaint that whole wall again. It's got a special paint job on it too. It's gonna cost about 500 bucks to fix.The following week later, he hit 280, which was a silent alarm. He hit it six times on someone else's keypad but he sent the cops out and my kids were at home. They didn't answer the door because they were scared and they didn't know what was going on because the alarm never went off. It took them about two and a half hours to figure out that the guy that set my alarm was using my password to reset someone else's alarm. I wasn't happy about that.It protects my house, but I'm not happy with the way my system was installed. All four doors are on a ringer and the other companies wouldn't do that. Now, you had to go through certain doors to get to the keypad. People come in all four doors and I got 30 seconds to get to my keypad to turn off the alarm. But it's all right. 300 bucks is pretty cheap.\n",

      "Some of my neighbors got ADT and I did some research online. We knew we wanted a security system, so we chose them. I got a mailer for a special deal. I would not have chosen them if I had not received a special promotion. It was $28 a month for monitoring. I called about it, ended up talking with a supervisor, and she even improved the benefits that were on the coupon. She expanded it from about $1,000 to $1,500 credit for whatever we ended up with for protection. She accommodated me, and she increased our benefits by 50%, so I was thankful for that.

She expanded it from about $1,000 to $1,500 credit for whatever we ended up with for protection. She accommodated me, and she increased our benefits by 50%, so I was thankful for that. The gentleman who came out to install the system was very knowledgeable. However, I felt like he was trying to sell us on stuff. He made a comment about how they come up with this total plan and then you work down from that. And he made the statement that he had to turn that in to the company, so he had to do that. My husband found it thrown in our recycle bin when he left. So, I’m not sure how honest he was about that. That bothered me a little.I don’t know if he took a photo of it with his phone to send it, but he threw it away in our recycle bin. And it felt like a sales pitch, which is just like, “Yeah. I have to do this ‘cause I have to turn this in. I have to show them that I’ve presented the whole plan to you,” which we were interested in because we just wanted the minimum to meet our needs. But it was okay. He was fine about what we agreed to do. I appreciated his expertise and his advice on what would work best in different areas. He actually did a great job. He was very accommodating. I had a bit of a concern with COVID-19. Should I really have this guy in my house? He was here for about four hours installing, but he was great. He wore a mask the entire time and was very cognizant of that, and he made sure the system was done to completion. He didn't leave here until it was 8 o’clock at night so he worked really hard.Now that we have lived with the system for about three weeks, there are a couple of tweaks that I’d like to make to it. Nothing major, but just in terms of when I want the alarm to sound outside. Maybe I can just call the installer and ask him to come back to make those adjustments. Or maybe they can do it over the phone. He gave us a business card because he said, “If you have any questions, just give me a call.” So, I thought I would start there and just see. But now, I’m quite satisfied with the system.I would definitely recommend ADT, but it’s a bit misleading when you get this coupon in the mail and it makes it sound like you’re going to get a free security system. You would pay a fee each month, but you would get this free system. And we ended up getting a pretty basic system, and it was not free, so that was a bit of a surprise. It’s not a cheap system by any means. It’s definitely more expensive than a do-it-yourself type. But we wanted ours to be a bit different. We didn't want a SimpliSafe system or something like that. So, ADT met our needs well.\n",

I will see what they do tomorrow with a new contract they are suppose to correct and redo things that the last criminal type of technician did towards my contract. I can still go to small claims court if they continue with this problem since I have all the proof of the contract. THEY are the worst company to resolve anything with. ADT and DEFENDERS stick together to get NOWHERE with them. They advertise 30 DAY CANCELLATION and even 6 MONTHS cancellation and it is all fraud as well. Do NOT get involved with this company since it's not the SAME COMPANY it used to be with ADT. DEFENDERS INC. is using ADT AUTHORIZED PREMIER PROVIDER and it is NOT COMPLETELY related to ADT anymore. Beware of this company.\n",

Then they talked to their manager and the manager came in with a special deal just for me. It’s frustrating that I spent so much time on the phone with them and then when the installer came out here, he had no idea what that conversation was. So it didn’t matter because there was no communication between the technician and the salesperson. It was all out the window. I was moving so I had a lot of other stuff going on and I couldn’t find the piece of paper I had taken the notes with during my initial sales call. So it wasn’t what I expected at all.

But there is probably better stuff. For example, I know there are smaller window alarm things that are more modern looking and not as bulky. I got the older version and for what I’m paying, it’s not satisfying. The price is kind of average as far as every other place but it's more than what I wanted and expected to pay, especially from the initial sales call.\n",

But the thing is that I told my husband, \"We go outside, we don''t know they''re gonna have a gun, they''re gonna shoot us.\"I just finished calling the officers right now. And I said, \"There''s two guys walking down the street. There''s a lot of activity going on. They''re passing by with compressors or weed eaters.\" So, one is looking on one side, the other one is looking at the other side. And they''re hoping to see what they will hit or when they will hit or what they will do. It just doesn''t feel good. That is when I said, \"That''s it.\"I noticed a couple of things missing. The side from the front and the front from the front towards where the house again are wide open. I have privacy fence all the way to the back. And then on the other side, my nextdoor neighbor has a chainlink. So, I''ve never felt like I needed a fence because I could be sitting here with my doors open. I felt safe. But now, I don''t. So, every time I left the house, I was worried.My daughter was telling me, \"Why don''t you do the cameras, mom, like that you can take a pic?\" I said, \"Well, I can barely afford this.\" She said, \"Mom, they have specials. Just call them. Maybe they can help you to set you up with a camera.\" Because it so happened that my front door neighbor, somebody passed. There''s a lot of activity going on that we never had before. They broke her window from the passenger side and the passenger side window and the mirror. They passed by, and they hit it with a BB gun. I said, \"If I had a camera, we would have gotten the vehicle and everything.\" This is all new to me. I''m not used to this. We always had little things happen, but we all keep an eye on each other. If anything, I would have to buy a camera and install Brinks or whatever that you just put them on yourself and be on the phone and look at what is going on.I was sitting outside and I kept seeing people passing by and then you could tell they''re on all those drugs and stuff. So, I said no. That''s when I saw Protect My Home''s Ad on Facebook and I called. I know they''re top-of-the-line. And then, it so happened that it was perfect timing because there was a special because of COVID. It was godsent. I''m really satisfied with the gentleman''s explanation who came with the installing. It took me a bit to get to understand it, but I''m almost where I need to be as far as disarming, arming, and staying. Customer service have been very patient and very detailed. So, I really appreciate that.The only thing that happened was, a couple of days ago, I was trying to get something from the top of the refrigerator. We''re seniors, and my hands are weak. I have a fractured rib that has been a permanent thing. So, when I was going to grab that thing, it fell, and the little casing fell off, and the alarm went off. Of course, I came and disarmed it right away, and I called in. They were able to walk me except that I said, \"You know what, I don''t know if this is gonna work. I have to get up the ladder to climb to take off the battery, restart it. And then I didn''t know how to put the lid back on.\" I have to go up and down the ladder because the alarm would go off. But we''ve been it long time. I live in Bath. As far as customer service, right away. I''m very satisfied with everything except that.My daughters all have the systems as well. I said, it''s not something that we can really afford but it''s something that I feel that we need. It''s more a necessity than a luxury because of the situation that''s going on right now. Even though we''re all neighbors, but sometimes some of us wanna travel and I go to the store and we go and work, like, \"Okay, is somebody going to break in?\" The system gives me peace of mind.','home neighborhood close years literally born home year could doors open within past maybe bit put system like weeks prior saw lot activity going morning course would go next door neighbors would go front door neighbors would go let know watching thing told husband go outside know gonna gun gonna shoot us home neighborhood close years literally born home year could doors open within past maybe bit put system like weeks prior saw lot activity going morning course would go next door neighbors would go front door neighbors would go let know watching thing told husband go outside know gonna gun gonna shoot us finished calling officers right said guys walking street lot activity going passing compressors weed eaters looking side looking side hoping see hit hit feel good said noticed couple things missing side front front front towards house wide open privacy fence way back side nextdoor neighbor chainlink never felt like needed fence could sitting doors open felt safe every time left house worried daughter telling cameras mom like take pic said well barely afford said mom specials call maybe help set camera happened front door neighbor somebody passed lot activity going never broke window passenger side passenger side window mirror passed hit bb gun said camera would gotten vehicle everything used always little things happen keep eye anything would buy camera install brinks whatever put phone look going sitting outside kept seeing passing could tell drugs stuff said saw protect home ad facebook called know top line happened perfect timing special covid godsent really satisfied gentleman explanation came installing took bit get understand almost need far disarming arming staying customer service patient detailed really appreciate thing happened couple days ago trying get something top refrigerator seniors hands weak fractured rib permanent thing going grab thing fell little casing fell alarm went course came disarmed right away called able walk except said know know gonna work get ladder climb take battery restart know put lid back go ladder alarm would go long time live bath far customer service right away satisfied everything except daughters systems well said something really afford something feel need necessity luxury situation going right even though neighbors sometimes us wanna travel go store go work like okay somebody going break system gives peace mind',0.128,0.812,0.061,0.9794)\n",

Still, the installer was great. He was on point and helped me out as much as he could to get what I''ve gotten. I like the system, but I would definitely have liked to add some more things to it without a big blimp payment to do it. However, if that''s the way it works, then there''s nothing I can do about it. Also, I have the app downloaded to my phone, which is nice. I can set the alarm and deactivate it when I get home. When I would set my alarm off, they would call me and they are very responsive. When they call though, they need to ask for a passcode and if you give them the wrong one, they need to send the cops.When I got home one day, I went in my garage and I set the alarm off. Once I figured out that my alarm was going off, I ran up to the house and deactivated it with my main controller. Someone from the company called me, but it was a little funny how that worked. She said I deactivated the alarm by my main controller and asked if everything was okay. I told her what had happened, then she said okay and that was it. I wasn''t even asked to give a passcode. What if somebody was standing here with a gun to my head? Of course, I''m going to tell them everything was okay, but if something was going on, there should be a word or a phrase that alerts them without alerting the thief or whoever it is that the cops are on their way.','seen adt signs around salesperson called said would give credits equipment got told wanted told would make huge payments paid figured would pay equipment throughout three years worked paid within four months told monthly installments would going work installer got done talked much pay many months thought would term contract purchased place option moment seen adt signs around salesperson called said would give credits equipment got told wanted told would make huge payments paid figured would pay equipment throughout three years worked paid within four months told monthly installments would going work installer got done talked much pay many months thought would term contract purchased place option moment ended paying something get system house felt misled situation salesperson beginning still installer great point helped much could get gotten like system would definitely liked add things without big blimp payment however way works nothing app downloaded phone nice set alarm deactivate get home would set alarm would call responsive call though need ask passcode give wrong need send cops got home day went garage set alarm figured alarm going ran house deactivated main controller someone company called little funny worked said deactivated alarm main controller asked everything okay told happened said okay even asked give passcode somebody standing gun head course going tell everything okay something going word phrase alerts without alerting thief whoever cops way',0.146,0.765,0.089,0.9431)\n",

They were not wearing masks, but that''s okay.They gave me an estimate of what it will cost me and it was completely different to what the lady on the phone has given me when I called the first time to ADT. But then, they listened to what I had to say about why I couldn''t pay the amount that they had on that. They accommodated the price according to my necessity and they sold the business. So, so far, I''m doing fine. The only problem that I''m having right now is when we have thunderstorms and lightning, sometimes the windows will vibrate, so the alarm goes off and I have to run. Other than that, I don''t have a problem and I have received some correspondence for $100 credit card that the company''s giving us. I have to go and find a money order, buy the money order, and send the $4.95, so I can get that amount of money. The two gentlemen that came were very professional. They are out to sell their product. Unfortunately, sometimes, consumers don''t have the money to pay what is there that they are selling. But they gave me what I needed. It was about $400 more than the initial that the lady has given me, but that is perfectly fine. When we call the company, the person on the phone could say, \"You know what, this is the minimum price that we have.” Then they will assess the risk. They will look at your house and your needs, and the price may vary to prepare the person on the other side.

I called about it, ended up talking with a supervisor, and she even improved the benefits that were on the coupon. She expanded it from about $1,000 to $1,500 credit for whatever we ended up with for protection. She accommodated me, and she increased our benefits by 50%, so I was thankful for that.

The gentleman who came out to install the system was very knowledgeable. However, I felt like he was trying to sell us on stuff. He made a comment about how they come up with this total plan and then you work down from that. And he made the statement that he had to turn that in to the company, so he had to do that. My husband found it thrown in our recycle bin when he left. So, I’m not sure how honest he was about that. That bothered me a little.I don’t know if he took a photo of it with his phone to send it, but he threw it away in our recycle bin. And it felt like a sales pitch, which is just like, “Yeah. I have to do this ‘cause I have to turn this in. I have to show them that I’ve presented the whole plan to you,” which we were interested in because we just wanted the minimum to meet our needs. But it was okay. He was fine about what we agreed to do. I appreciated his expertise and his advice on what would work best in different areas. He actually did a great job. He was very accommodating. I had a bit of a concern with COVID-19. Should I really have this guy in my house? He was here for about four hours installing, but he was great. He wore a mask the entire time and was very cognizant of that, and he made sure the system was done to completion. He didn''t leave here until it was 8 o’clock at night so he worked really hard.Now that we have lived with the system for about three weeks, there are a couple of tweaks that I’d like to make to it. Nothing major, but just in terms of when I want the alarm to sound outside. Maybe I can just call the installer and ask him to come back to make those adjustments. Or maybe they can do it over the phone. He gave us a business card because he said, “If you have any questions, just give me a call.” So, I thought I would start there and just see. But now, I’m quite satisfied with the system.I would definitely recommend ADT, but it’s a bit misleading when you get this coupon in the mail and it makes it sound like you’re going to get a free security system. You would pay a fee each month, but you would get this free system. And we ended up getting a pretty basic system, and it was not free, so that was a bit of a surprise. It’s not a cheap system by any means. It’s definitely more expensive than a do-it-yourself type. But we wanted ours to be a bit different. We didn''t want a SimpliSafe system or something like that.

You’ll get a contract in the mail within three days. And when you do, you have three days to rescind.” And then he walked off. She said, “Well, okay. If that’s what is supposed to happen, that’s the way we’ll do it.” So, we waited.By the second day, I haven''t gotten anything and I was looking for it so I called. It was installed on a Saturday, so I called on a Tuesday. And the person I spoke to said, “Yeah. There is no contract. It’s been terminated.” And I’m like, “Oh. So, there''s nothing I have to do?” They said, “Yeah. That’s right. There''s nothing you have to do. It’s been terminated.” So, about two weeks later, I went back to the condo and I assumed that they were going call me to come back to get their equipment.And at this point in time, by the way, I didn''t know there was a difference between ADT and Defenders. And apparently, the way this works, I’ve now learned this is ADT and then ADT contacts whoever their regional representative is in a territory, and they install it. And they take it for the first 30 or 60 days, and then they turn it over to ADT. But again, I didn''t know that at the time, so I was only dealing with ADT. So, I called ADT and said, “I never got this contract that I was supposed to get. And I called and they said that it was terminated. No one has ever come to get this equipment, and it’s kind of in the way. It’s on the wall and stuff.” And they said, “Let us switch you to this other person.” So, they switched me to this other person. I’ve been assuming that was Defenders.And Defenders looked at it and said, “The contract’s in place and you owe us money. You gotta pay for this. There''s no way to terminate it.” I said, “Wait a minute.” I told them the story, went back and forth with them, and they were, quite honestly, not particularly helpful about the circumstances. And so, I asked to speak to a supervisor, which I did. And when I got the supervisor, she looked at the policy, went, “Huh. Yeah. It doesn’t look like we ever sent you your contract. It looks like we’ve got a bad email address.” I said, “Okay.” I didn''t ask whose email it went to, but she just said it was bad. She said, “Give me your email address again. I’m also gonna mail it to you.” And I said, “Look. You mail it to me, make sure you mail it to my house,” because it’s during the COVID stuff. And she said, “Okay. Just be looking for it.” So, seemed like we were back on track.I waited and waited and nothing showed up. So, I called back and said, “Hey, I never got anything.” And I was talking to the ADT people, and the ADT people said, “You need to take that up with Defenders.” And when I talked to Defenders, again, not very helpful, and basically said, “Sorry, nothing we can do.” And so, I called back to ADT.And every time I made these phone calls, I don’t know how to reach Defenders, so I’m calling a number and it’s ADT, and ADT switching me to them. I’m literally on the phone sometimes for an hour, maybe an hour and a half, on hold, then transferred between people. It almost feels like by design, it’s very difficult. They make it very difficult on you to solve a problem. So, I get shifted to the ADT person who reads all my records and goes, “Yeah. You called like within three days. I don’t know what the deal is. And so, let us shift you back to Defenders.” And that’s when I figured out this difference. And Defenders got on the phone, said, “You''d have to give us something in writing in three days.” I said, “Yeah. I know, but I was told that it would be coming and it never did.” And they said, “You don’t have to wait. You can just send us something.” I said, “Yeah. But no one told me that. I didn’t get a contract. There''s nothing, all right?”And they said, “You didn''t send anything. And so, sorry, there''s nothing we can do.” And so, “Let me talk to your supervisor.” I talked with the supervisor, and the supervisor said, “Look. You should’ve just sent us something in writing. And by the way, did you get the person’s name you spoke to on that Tuesday when you first called?” I said, “No. They told me there wasn’t a contract.\" I didn''t know that I needed to take their name, rank, and serial number when they gave me the answers that I thought was consistent with the behavior that we all discussed this Saturday.And it kinda deteriorated from there until my last phone call with ADT and Defenders last week. I had them both on the phone. They were pointing a finger at each other. Basically, ADT is saying, “We can’t do anything. Defenders has to…” And Defenders are saying, “We didn''t get the three-day notice, so we can’t do anything. You’re gonna have to take it up with ADT.” And I said, “Okay. I want you both on the phone.” So, when I was talking to Defenders, I got the ADT person on the phone. And both of them kinda said, “We can’t help you. You’re just gonna have to send in a complaint,” which was like, “Okay.”I’ve literally spent hours at this point on the telephone. I’ve done everything that was required of me at every step of the way. I’ve taken every instruction. And to this day, the system is still here. They''re charging me for it. They haven''t given me my money back. I didn''t want it. I told them I didn''t want it the moment it showed up because the price changed. They installed it anyway, and no one is willing to solve this problem. So, I wrote a letter that outlined all this. Someone called from ADT the day I wrote the letter and said, “Look, I’m gonna get back to you in 24 to 48 hours and we’re gonna get this straightened out.” I was very appreciative of that. Although so far, every time I’ve talked to ADT, they have been willing to solve the problem, but they keep sending it back to Defenders. And I can tell Defenders is not willing to solve the problem.I don’t know whether this is by design, that it’s a black hat/white hat thing going on, where ADT says, “Hey, we’re gonna hire you guys, Defenders. You’ll take all the slings and arrows so we can keep our image clean,” or if there genuinely is this level of disconnection in the system. But either way, I’m not a satisfied customer. ADT has been very pleasant. They have taken my phone calls. While they put me on hold for a long time every time we’ve gone through it, they sound as though they''re trying to fix the problem. It’s just that it’s not fixed.','standpoint dealing adt advertising television internet whole bit pretty good marketing initial sales experience seemed fine talked salesman telephone talked system price everything got set responsive asked system next day gave early date install next day initial interaction adt phone getting time set everything worked well problems really started next day installation standpoint dealing adt advertising television internet whole bit pretty good marketing initial sales experience seemed fine talked salesman telephone talked system price everything got set responsive asked system next day gave early date install next day initial interaction adt phone getting time set everything worked well problems really started next day installation next day set appointment condominium renovating showed wife meet installer equipment e pads contract go going price quoted per month go initial page flips go next page e pad getting bottom said cost gonna number considerably higher said wait minute number husband told agreed call yesterday said well said let get husband line know pretty big difference gonna need talk got line gave explanation going higher said yeah afford rental unit already stretch whatever number price range agreement fellow yesterday said anything said install big change wife walked stuff contractors installed system wife came back went equipment told want said walking look rescission get contract mail within three days three days rescind walked said well okay supposed happen way waited second day gotten anything looking called installed saturday called tuesday person spoke said yeah contract terminated like oh nothing said yeah right nothing terminated weeks later went back condo assumed going call come back get equipment point time way know difference adt defenders apparently way works learned adt adt contacts whoever regional representative territory install take first days turn adt know time dealing adt called adt said never got contract supposed get called said terminated ever come get equipment kind way wall stuff said let us switch person switched person assuming defenders defenders looked said contract place owe us money gotta pay way terminate said wait minute told story went back forth quite honestly particularly helpful circumstances asked speak supervisor got supervisor looked policy went huh yeah look like ever sent contract looks like got bad email address said okay ask whose email went said bad said give email address gonna mail said look mail make sure mail house covid stuff said okay looking seemed like back track waited waited nothing showed called back said hey never got anything talking adt adt said need take defenders talked defenders helpful basically said sorry nothing called back adt every time made phone calls know reach defenders calling number adt adt switching literally phone sometimes hour maybe hour half hold transferred almost feels like design difficult make difficult solve problem get shifted adt person reads records goes yeah called like within three days know deal let us shift back defenders figured difference defenders got phone said give us something writing three days said yeah know told would coming never said wait send us something said yeah told get contract nothing right said send anything sorry nothing let talk supervisor talked supervisor supervisor said look sent us something writing way get person name spoke tuesday first called said told contract know needed take name rank serial number gave answers thought consistent behavior discussed saturday kinda deteriorated last phone call adt defenders last week phone pointing finger basically adt saying anything defenders defenders saying get three day notice anything gonna take adt said okay want phone talking defenders got adt person phone kinda said help gonna send complaint like okay literally spent hours point telephone done everything required every step way taken every instruction day system still charging given money back want told want moment showed price changed installed anyway willing solve problem wrote letter outlined someone called adt day wrote letter said look gonna get back hours gonna get straightened appreciative although far every time talked adt willing solve problem keep sending back defenders tell defenders willing solve problem know whether design black hat white hat thing going adt says hey gonna hire guys defenders take slings arrows keep image clean genuinely level disconnection system either way satisfied customer adt pleasant taken phone calls put hold long time every time gone sound though trying fix problem fixed',0.182,0.768,0.05,0.9971)\n",

They gave me a credit for that but I ended up having to pay $84 for the camera. Overall, the cost is very okay. It’s 53.99 a month so you can''t beat that.

I have Vivint and my neighbor told me her car has been broken in five times so, I feel good about the decision I made.Zach, the young guy who came the first time didn''t put things back where he got them from. It was a mess and when I went downstairs, the blinds were still up. He left and didn''t give me my sign. I had to call in to get it. There was something else he did and I didn''t like him. Then, this other gentleman came and installed my camera and made sure everything was done. He made sure I got my sign and he brought me a sign too. So, I ended up with three signs. He told me what he was doing. Zach did his job and he upgraded me also and then, I upgraded again. I got the doorbell camera. I was told that it would be recording people walking up to your door. But people literally have to press the doorbell in order for it to work. It’s not a good thing because I''ve been watching the news and they showed people stealing their packages on the door. Mine didn''t even record anything.I come up to my door every day but there''s no recording of it. So, I wonder why that is. I would like to see me coming. I know I can''t see around that corner but when I get in front of the camera, I would like to see somebody is at the door. But the other day, I know this gentleman came to my door and he stuck his head and peeked. Then, he rang the doorbell but I couldn''t even talk to him while he was at my door. He put the mail on my door and covered up my camera. If I had been able to talk to him, I might have been able to tell him not to do that and to move out of the way. I wasn''t able to do that because the talk button didn''t work properly. I''m not impressed with it at all and it''s no good especially when it doesn''t tell you that you can talk. The option to talk did nothing and the guy was at the door. He rung it twice and I wasn''t able to say anything. I''m kinda dissatisfied because I went through a lot to get the ring and then, it was not what I thought it was gonna be.

I’m always trying on our system and they’ve changed the battery but we’re back in the same boat that we were in before we called them the first time.

The guy, when he installed, within three days, it is off two times. \"That is our mistake,\" the guy said, when he came the second time. And then, they called us. They said, \"We have to charge you $500.\" That''s not really good. That''s not our mistake, and then we don''t have to get charged with that.We canceled before the three days. We faxed everything back to the company the second day. But still they came in, they saw and put in an extra one motion detector and then two cameras, but they''re not working. And then, they charged me extra. The guy told us the first time 450 plus. Then this month is free, June 23 only the first payment, he said. And in June, they charged us an extra 500. They said, \"You have to pay for the police.\" Why? You don''t pay for that. I have to call the main company because there is a lot fouls and charges. Plus, it''s the waiting and waiting.','home anything system case emergency go anywhere living home got number website called questions built asking anybody electronic installing charge time took number everything good forced interest main thing home anything system case emergency go anywhere living home got number website called questions built asking anybody electronic installing charge time took number everything good forced interest main thing however happy system sometimes working first image clear second recording time third night camera freezing camera recording time went even test goes coming records going know going trying call protect home today time day installer called came back installed another second still happy good protect home called us last week told us deal issue guy installed within three days times mistake guy said came second time called us said charge really good mistake get charged canceled three days faxed everything back company second day still came saw put extra motion detector cameras working charged extra guy told us first time plus month free june first payment said june charged us extra said pay police pay call main company lot fouls charges plus waiting waiting',0.187,0.687,0.126,0.9394)\n",

And also the flyer tells that I''m gonna get the alarm itself, the sensors for the front and backdoor and it also said that I''m gonna get a remote control. And I did get a remote control and a doorbell camera. I was also supposed to get a surveillance camera. I had expressed over the phone when I first called them that I wanted all my windows to get sensors, but I was told that ADT did a survey of some type and found that there was no need to put a sensor on all my windows because what they offered now would be one sensor that detects glass breaking. But the key to getting the surveillance camera and the doorbell camera was there was an extra charge of $299. I left one system going to a new system. The system that I left from had given me a smoke detector so I asked them about getting the smoke detector. So, the bottom line is, by the time I got the things that I need with ADT my bill was up to 1000 and something dollars.I also didn’t want to have that glass breaking sensor because I told the tech, “Well, if I’m in the house washing dishes and I have to drop something, or somebody drops something and it sounds like glass my alarm is gonna go off.” And he said, “Yes.” And he said, “But you can just turn it right off. The police won’t be coming because if you turn it off immediately, you won’t have any problems.” I said, \"I like the idea of having the sensors on my windows itself. Whichever window they’re gonna try to attempt to come through, the system will let me know which window it was.”I was more comfortable with having the sensors on each window so I had to pay for that. By the time I finished my bill was not 27.99. My monthly payment is 53 something. In the last two weeks, they’ve also had flyers coming in through the weekly circular for the markets. Now, they’re offering the 12 sensors for your windows. I was like, “I couldn’t get them.” I had to pay for mine. I was gonna call them and then say to them, “I think you owe me a refund. Because it’s been less than a month and you’re now advertising those 12 sensors. And when I got mine, I was told they weren’t being offered.” Now, the tech himself did a beautiful job. He did exactly what was meant for him to do because he came out with the listing of what I was supposed to get based on my initial call-in. He had to call back to the main office to find out if I qualify. And he also found out if he could give me some discounts because I turned down the surveillance camera and the doorbell camera. And because it was already offered on the flyer that I had, he said he had to call the office to see if they can give me a discount for one of the sensors that I wanted to put on my window. That’s how my bill got lowered because he called in, and they offered a discount because I was removing the two cameras from my package. But I ended up paying 400 and something dollars originally. I also called them back a week later because I found out that they had given me the main box downstairs.I had a relative that came over that had access to my house and that particular day I was upstairs washing my hair and I had the blow dryer on. I didn’t know anyone had come into the house, and I had the alarm on. So he yelled up the steps and called me. When I heard him, I said, “Oh, my goodness. Somebody’s in the house.” So, I turned my hairdryer off, and I recognized the voice. It bothered me that I was in the house with the blow dryer running and didn’t hear the alarm. But I was able to disarm it before the police came. I remembered that with my old system there was also a sensor put upstairs, which means that when I’m upstairs I can hear the alarm from upstairs. So, I had to call ADT back to see if they offered that particular sensor. And they did, but I had to pay for it. That cost me 100 and something dollars. So the tech came back and installed it upstairs. So now when anyone opens any door or any window within the house it’d be heard upstairs even if you have the TV on, or if you’re in the shower.','got adt flyer came mail aunt recommended gotten service flyer misleading original starting price supposed see anything offered told gonna something flyer tells gonna get alarm sensors front backdoor said gonna get remote control get remote control doorbell camera supposed get surveillance camera got adt flyer came mail aunt recommended gotten service flyer misleading original starting price supposed see anything offered told gonna something flyer tells gonna get alarm sensors front backdoor said gonna get remote control get remote control doorbell camera supposed get surveillance camera expressed phone first called wanted windows get sensors told adt survey type found need put sensor windows offered would sensor detects glass breaking key getting surveillance camera doorbell camera extra charge left system going system system left given smoke detector asked getting smoke detector bottom line time got things need adt bill something dollars want glass breaking sensor told tech well house washing dishes drop something somebody drops something sounds like glass alarm gonna go said yes said turn right police coming turn immediately problems said like idea sensors windows whichever window gonna try attempt come system let know window comfortable sensors window pay time finished bill monthly payment something last weeks flyers coming weekly circular markets offering sensors windows like get pay mine gonna call say think owe refund less month advertising sensors got mine told offered tech beautiful job exactly meant came listing supposed get based initial call call back main office find qualify found could give discounts turned surveillance camera doorbell camera already offered flyer said call office see give discount sensors wanted put window bill got lowered called offered discount removing cameras package ended paying something dollars originally called back week later found given main box downstairs relative came access house particular day upstairs washing hair blow dryer know anyone come house alarm yelled steps called heard said oh goodness somebody house turned hairdryer recognized voice bothered house blow dryer running hear alarm able disarm police came remembered old system sensor put upstairs means upstairs hear alarm upstairs call adt back see offered particular sensor pay cost something dollars tech came back installed upstairs anyone opens door window within house heard upstairs even tv shower',0.08,0.839,0.081,0.34)\n",

However, there were not honest responses that I got from her, which I didn''t find out until later. As far as phone etiquette, she was quite impressive.The first installer was great and good at talking. He answered some questions quite honestly that the rep was very misleading about as far as what would be included. The one problem I had was him trying to get through to the connection of whoever he needed to call to get authorization. It was like a nightmare here in my home from 3:00 until close to 8:00 PM with all the installation. But the bulk of the time was taken up with him trying to get a service rep to assist him with completing the installation, which ran until darkness. This was new for me, so I was looking for someone to suggest to me where the placement of cameras should go and what I needed. He was very courteous, but he left holes and damage to my house. I could tell he was frustrated because he couldn''t get through to the people he needed.I liked the second guy that came out because after I told him what I wanted, he pointed out that the front camera was placed in the wrong positioning. I said, “I can''t see who''s at the front door.” So, the way the first installer placed it was of no benefit. The second guy said, “I''m going to move a few places. You look at it and you tell me if this is a view that will benefit you.” He moved it to the entire other end of the house, which was totally off what the first guy did. Also, he did his best to fill in the holes with what the first guy did. It''s kind of shoddy because it doesn''t match. It’s just kind of clear something just to clog up the hole so that bugs and bees could not get in. But he didn''t leave until I was satisfied with the positioning. I like  the system, but I felt like a senior that was taken advantage of. I wouldn''t recommend ADT.','adt quite famous think home security first comes mind rep protect home extremely friendly customer oriented patient lot time answer questions however honest responses got find later far phone etiquette quite impressive adt quite famous think home security first comes mind rep protect home extremely friendly customer oriented patient lot time answer questions however honest responses got find later far phone etiquette quite impressive first installer great good talking answered questions quite honestly rep misleading far would included problem trying get connection whoever needed call get authorization like nightmare home close pm installation bulk time taken trying get service rep assist completing installation ran darkness looking someone suggest placement cameras go needed courteous left holes damage house could tell frustrated get needed liked second guy came told wanted pointed front camera placed wrong positioning said see front door way first installer placed benefit second guy said going move places look tell view benefit moved entire end house totally first guy best fill holes first guy kind shoddy match kind clear something clog hole bugs bees could get leave satisfied positioning like system felt like senior taken advantage recommend adt',0.32,0.607,0.073,0.996)\n",

I told them not to send the same guy ''cause he obviously didn''t know how to fix it and I didn''t need him burning down my house if he was out here. So, she sent another guy who told me that he couldn''t fix it either. He said that I''d need an electrician.I had to call an electrician to fix it and it was almost a month later before I could get the electrician here. I decided to cancel it because the electrician was gonna charge me almost $1300 to rewire the doorbell. The guys from Protect Your Home came out on the 13th and took some of the equipment. The supervisor and the installer said they would refund me the money and they called somebody. It was then verified that I was going to keep the service and that they were gonna give me a refund, but they were gonna take back some of their equipment. They took back the tablet, which I didn''t need ''cause I had my phone. I''ve called twice about the refund and I still haven''t received a refund. I finally have a doorbell but it''s not by the ADT.

I asked what was going on and they said I needed to get an electrician in to improve the cable. I wound up having to get an electrician and they ran a new wire out there. It was an extra cost and I didn''t anticipate that. They also sold me a door key lock that was able to be turned on and off on the app and it doesn''t have enough Wi-Fi.They gave me a small range extender, which was a switch on and off. Shortly after they left, that died as well, so now, I have to manually lock my lock. I have a feeling it could be the Wi-Fi and I''ll probably have to get a range extender in the house.

Two days later, they sent out the manager of the two gentlemen that came here. He wasn''t here for 15 minutes and he stated that he couldn''t hook our cameras and our stuff back up as we wanted them. I then called ADT and I complained and tried to cancel the entire contract. I had already spent about $500 at that point.ADT told me that they would cancel me out in June the 13th, and they charged me another $100 then Defenders told me that I owed them 2,000 and something dollars because I didn''t cancel the contract in three days. I told them they stalled me and said they would send a manager out to me so they would get past the three-day window, which includes Saturday and Sunday. I didn''t like the whole process.

My husband and I were very happy with all of the set up that the previous owner had done with motion sensors and glass break. It’s not the most technologically sexy but it was all very well secured. So, we just wanted the present system in our house to be activated again so that it was set up to contact the police. I called ADT and talked to them.

My husband and I were very happy with all of the set up that the previous owner had done with motion sensors and glass break. It’s not the most technologically sexy but it was all very well secured. So, we just wanted the present system in our house to be activated again so that it was set up to contact the police. I called ADT and talked to them. I’m a Fire Reserve and I would get kind of a cashback if I set everything up with ADT. I didn’t realize it because it was Protection One. I just thought it was the same thing and I just figured that they could use the system we have. I called this person and that phone call was very misleading from what happened when they came to my house. I told the guy what I wanted and maybe it was a miscommunication but he made it seem like they could do it. He told me about some credit that I was gonna be given which will more than cover anything that I might need to do to the system. So, I was under the impression that the only thing I would be paying for is the new monthly service. The day that the guy showed up from ADT, he was trying to sell me almost $8,000 worth of new alarm system. So, that was the first experience that was totally disjointed from what I was told on the phone. So, I said that my husband and I are not looking to do any of this. We live in a very safe neighborhood and we feel very safe with the system that we have. We don’t need all the new gadgets. We just want it hooked up so that the police would be informed, and the guy just kept pushing us. We said that if they wanna go, we can maybe call Protection One and have them do it. He wouldn’t leave and he said he didn’t wanna leave us unprotected and that he wanna leave our house safer than he came. So, we talked it out and then, he said that he got some tech guy to come and they said that they could do a takeover of our current system and rewire it to ADT. Then, they said that they could add a few things in if we wanted them. We ended up paying maybe $300 instead of $8,000. So, we said that was fine. They dismantled what we had and then they left, and they said they would come back. Even though the system wasn’t hooked up to the police, at least we had the deterrent. If someone did break in, the alarm would go off. They came back another day to do the takeover and that day, they didn’t have all of the equipment that they needed to fully do the takeover. So, they did a partial job. They said that the rest of the equipment was gonna be coming within a week, and again, they left us less protected.No one ever called me and no one followed up ever about this equipment. They said it would be a week but a week went by and there was nothing. I gave them some more time and then, I reached out. I have the cellphone of the guy who came to our house. So, I texted him and called him. He told me that he didn’t know about this conversation that the tech guy had with us and he was not sure what we were talking about, and that I had to call ADT. So, he left me hanging like that. It’s now almost a month since they came at my home. It’s not fully protected so, I called ADT. They sent Jeff, another tech guy, two days ago and he didn’t know what the equipment was that we needed. So, he came and assessed it, and he called his boss. I overheard them talking and saying that that equipment was never even ordered in the first place. So, it was not like it was ordered and it’s backordered. What we were waiting on is something called like a wireless transmitter so that they can rewire what’s already in our house to the new system, and then we were waiting on two more shock sensors. Jeff was trying to argue with me about the price. I told him that I’m a reasonable person but I’ve been living in my home and paying a fee of $50 a month to them since they came with no protection. It would be the reasonable and right thing to do to just tell us not to worry about it and that they’ve got this and would cover the cost. It’s $79 and not like it’s $700. I don’t think I should have to pay another dollar to ADT. I feel like they have been dishonest and unaccountable for everything such as telling me that they would follow up and no one did.So then Jeff said to let him order the equipment and he would call me the next day to let me know what was going on. I said that was okay. That was on Tuesday and on Wednesday, there was no call. I didn’t have Jeff’s number because they wouldn’t give it to me. The tech guy that was in my house said he was not at liberty to give me his number, but he would give me his. So, I texted and called that guy. He never responded to me. I called the main number of ADT again and reported all these. They got Jeff on the phone but they wouldn’t let me talk to him. They said that they couldn’t give me his number. They couldn’t connect me to him but they would talk to him. He claimed that he ordered it but there was no date of when it was gonna arrive. So, he was waiting for that to call me. My only point that I made to their customer service rep that was on the phone with me was that it would be the right thing with a customer like this who has had so many issues that if they said that they were gonna call, they should call. And even if they didn’t have the date, they could say that they ordered the equipment and that as soon as they know what day it was gonna arrive, he would call me back and we would make a plan. To not call and follow up at all is awful service in my mind. I said that I still wanna talk to him that day even though he said he ordered it because I had other questions for him. So, I asked that he call me back when he can. The rep said he was on a conference call but she would email him to call me. And then nothing. I never heard from him. This is a crazy time with COVID and everything that’s going on, and I know things get backordered. I’m a very reasonable person and a lot more people would be more agitated but the only thing that bothered me the most wasn’t the delay in service but the dishonesty and unaccountability. You shouldn’t be having to chase people down. At this point, I almost wanna pull my service and go to someone else. The only reason I’m not is because I put in so much work and effort to get this set up that I can’t even imagine having to call another company and have them come out and survey the property. It’s like a whole thing to start over. If it was easier, I’m just gonna go find someone else to help me.','came home prior owner protection husband happy set previous owner done motion sensors glass break technologically sexy well secured wanted present system house activated set contact police called adt talked fire reserve would get kind cashback set everything adt realize protection thought thing figured could use system came home prior owner protection husband happy set previous owner done motion sensors glass break technologically sexy well secured wanted present system house activated set contact police called adt talked fire reserve would get kind cashback set everything adt realize protection thought thing figured could use system called person phone call misleading happened came house told guy wanted maybe miscommunication made seem like could told credit gonna given cover anything might need system impression thing would paying monthly service day guy showed adt trying sell almost worth alarm system first experience totally disjointed told phone said husband looking live safe neighborhood feel safe system need gadgets want hooked police would informed guy kept pushing us said wanna go maybe call protection leave said wanna leave us unprotected wanna leave house safer came talked said got tech guy come said could takeover current system rewire adt said could add things wanted ended paying maybe instead said fine dismantled left said would come back even though system hooked police least deterrent someone break alarm would go came back another day takeover day equipment needed fully takeover partial job said rest equipment gonna coming within week left us less protected ever called followed ever equipment said would week week went nothing gave time reached cellphone guy came house texted called told know conversation tech guy us sure talking call adt left hanging like almost month since came home fully protected called adt sent jeff another tech guy days ago know equipment needed came assessed called boss overheard talking saying equipment never even ordered first place like ordered backordered waiting something called like wireless transmitter rewire already house system waiting shock sensors jeff trying argue price told reasonable person living home paying fee month since came protection would reasonable right thing tell us worry got would cover cost like think pay another dollar adt feel like dishonest unaccountable everything telling would follow jeff said let order equipment would call next day let know going said okay tuesday wednesday call jeff number give tech guy house said liberty give number would give texted called guy never responded called main number adt reported got jeff phone let talk said give number connect would talk claimed ordered date gonna arrive waiting call point made customer service rep phone would right thing customer like many issues said gonna call call even date could say ordered equipment soon know day gonna arrive would call back would make plan call follow awful service mind said still wanna talk day even though said ordered questions asked call back rep said conference call would email call nothing never heard crazy time covid everything going know things get backordered reasonable person lot would agitated thing bothered delay service dishonesty unaccountability chase point almost wanna pull service go someone else reason put much work effort get set even imagine call another company come survey property like whole thing start easier gonna go find someone else help',0.149,0.775,0.076,0.9913)\n",

I''ve had a few false alarms, but I can''t say that was to the fault of the alarm itself.

She transferred me back and I scheduled for the installer to come out. I check my credit all the time because I was a victim of identity theft.

Protect Your Home came recommended by a neighbor and when we moved in, a lot of the neighbors had their service.I had previously been with Xfinity Home but due to the situation and the virus, when we switched our service, they were not able to come in to do the security. My husband was being deployed and I was gonna be here alone with the kids, so I really wanted something. Protect Your Home came recommended by a neighbor and when we moved in, a lot of the neighbors had their service.I contacted them and the sales rep that I dealt with was good. But when I first called and we went over the information, they took my initial $99 payment then when I asked twice if that was all I would pay, they said yes. I wouldn’t have doubted that because that was how it worked with my Xfinity before. I just paid $100 for the camera and the monthly fee and they didn''t charge for any of the other equipment. But when the person from Protect Your Home came out, I was absolutely floored when I found out that everything that I wanted for my home cost over $3,000. The person on the phone told me that only the monthly fee would be affected by what equipment you want, how many cameras you want, and what windows you want sensors on. He never said anything about additional charges despite me asking about me paying more than that $99. And I paid over $3,000 the day the tech came. Also, he was here from 8:30 in the morning until 8 o’clock at night in my brand-new house. So not only was I out all that money in the middle of moving, in the middle COVID-19, working from home, and having four kids at home because school is closed. I also had the inconvenience of a tech in my house for 12 hours, which I did not expect. We didn''t even wanna eat dinner because we felt uncomfortable eating in front of him. And while he was very nice, he made a really big hole in my wall and he couldn’t get the thing to string through. So, instead of it being by the front door, he moved it by the bathroom in between two of the bedrooms and he offered to come back and fix it. But I had my son-in-law fix it because that’s what he does for a living. Besides that, three days after we got the system installed, I got a letter from ADT saying that my service was not active. I called them and they said it was active. But I told them that I got a letter saying that it was not and every time I tried to look on the cameras, there was nothing. I kept trying to watch the clips on my phone. We have two cameras, one in the front and one in the back, and there was never any clip. I was wondering if they even worked. I had the service for a good three weeks but none of the cameras were picking up anything.So, I had to call back and explain that to them. I told them that when I had Xfinity, I watched everything. Every time there was a motion in front of one of my cameras, it recorded that and I could text or email it to my husband if he was away. I also could play it back. But the person that answered the phone on that phone call, which was now my third phone call with ADT, was very snippy and rude. She could care less about me, which kind of caused me to get a little bit agitated. She said that what the reps should have explained to me was that if I wanted the equipment to record when I''m home, then I needed to go into my app and set that up. But nobody told me that and she didn''t offer to walk me through it. She was not at all customer-friendly.Other than the two cameras, I have 14 windows total in my house. I have sensors on every window because I have kids upstairs. And on the downstairs floor, we have knee-level windows. I have two sensors at the front door and the back door. And I have the key fob and the keypad. Also, I did the smoke detector and the two carbon monoxide. I took everything that the rep offered because I wanna feel protected. And right now, with what’s going on in the world, I’m glad that I did. But while I am satisfied with the equipment, I felt like every step of the way I was not steered in the right direction. I am so disappointed and I hate to keep comparing, but that was not my experience with Xfinity at all and with them, I never had any of these issues. AIl in all, I would not recommend Protect Your Home because I did not feel that they were upfront. I felt very misled and not well taken care of.','xfinity home due situation virus switched service able come security husband deployed gonna alone kids really wanted something protect home came recommended neighbor moved lot neighbors service xfinity home due situation virus switched service able come security husband deployed gonna alone kids really wanted something protect home came recommended neighbor moved lot neighbors service contacted sales rep dealt good first called went information took initial payment asked twice would pay said yes doubted worked xfinity paid camera monthly fee charge equipment person protect home came absolutely floored found everything wanted home cost person phone told monthly fee would affected equipment want many cameras want windows want sensors never said anything additional charges despite asking paying paid day tech came morning clock night brand house money middle moving middle covid working home four kids home school closed inconvenience tech house hours expect even wanna eat dinner felt uncomfortable eating front nice made really big hole wall get thing string instead front door moved bathroom bedrooms offered come back fix son law fix living besides three days got system installed got letter adt saying service active called said active told got letter saying every time tried look cameras nothing kept trying watch clips phone cameras front back never clip wondering even worked service good three weeks none cameras picking anything call back explain told xfinity watched everything every time motion front cameras recorded could text email husband away could play back person answered phone phone call third phone call adt snippy rude could care less kind caused get little bit agitated said reps explained wanted equipment record home needed go app set nobody told offer walk customer friendly cameras windows total house sensors every window kids upstairs downstairs floor knee level windows sensors front door back door key fob keypad smoke detector carbon monoxide took everything rep offered wanna feel protected right going world glad satisfied equipment felt like every step way steered right direction disappointed hate keep comparing experience xfinity never issues ail would recommend protect home feel upfront felt misled well taken care',0.176,0.753,0.072,0.9891)\n",

It was just too much. When he got here, I was working virtually. I had a conference call that I was presenting to the staff, so I couldn’t truly focus at that time, but he kept going about all these different numbers. Then he said the monthly amount didn’t apply because if I got that version of ADT, my house could be breached. He didn’t recommend that, and he recommended me to have the type that if someone would come in, if they could cut the cords outside, and it still would automatically keep my house safe. He also told me that the camera is free, but I have to pay for the connection. That was what added to my package and my monthly price. I don’t know how true that was, but all of it didn’t seem right. I wanted to stop then. I told him that I''d think about it then he started going down on the price.He had put my stuff in and he missed about five sensors. I took the pictures and showed him that he didn’t do these walls. Then I got door activation and it wouldn’t work on my phone. I even told Protect Your Home about it. When I left my home, if I wasn’t in front of my home, I couldn’t access to look at my house or the website, or to arm my house. What’s the purpose of having this when I can’t even make sure my home is safe if I’m not at home?I called and they told me it could be my internet. I had the internet that everybody else has. They sent someone else out the next day and the guy was really nice although he was worn at that point. He installed everything that the first guy didn’t put in. The first guy didn’t program my child’s windows to the actual system. He had to program that in. Then the keypad that I had didn’t work and he fixed that. He also put the six sensors in and enabled it to where I could access it on my phone. With the COVID stuff, this first guy lied to me also. When I saw him taking his boxes, he said that he would take his stuff and throw it in the trash. However, he left about 12 boxes on my bar and said that he could not touch them. It’s a policy that the customer has to throw out all the boxes that they have. What we buy, we have to throw them away. He also left a bottle that he was evidently dipping snuff or spitting in on the counter with it. But the next gentleman took his stuff. I was trying to change the code on my door one time and my alarm went off. The gentleman didn’t leave any pamphlet or information about getting in contact with ADT. When I was married, I had ADT. That was another reason why I kinda chose it but I didn’t have any of that information. I had to google ADT and they transferred to the different areas. The person that I spoke with sent me her email if I had any problems and I liked that. I told Protect Your Home that I wanted to cancel. They told me someone would call. They didn’t call. I have this plan that I’m still dissatisfied with.

By the time I got to the house, which was about 15 minutes after they called me and said he was there, he had already had it connected. All he needed to do was tell me how the keypad worked and from there, he put up the windows, the doors, and all that. All of that took him about 45 minutes then he asked me a couple of questions, the where and how. I answered his questions, and he put them up.All in all, the system is easy to manage, but I ran into a little situation where one of the bars that was put on the window had fallen off. I just put it back and it stayed there since.

So far, the service has been very good. But we noticed a couple of extra things that we would like to add in the future, like cameras for peace of mind. I’ve always thought that it’s very complicated to activate and deactivate it and that you''d end up triggering it by mistake. However, it was very user-friendly and really easy to use.

Neff then informed us that it was an add on that would cost more, when we were under the impression that it was already included in the package we discussed and agreed to.We then asked Chris about it and he came over to the house to discuss our concerns. He told me that my wife must have heard it incorrectly which I didn’t appreciate at all because I heard exactly what she was told because I was there as well. I then proceeded to over hear him tell our technician “we were the only customers he has had that misinterpreted what he said” while my wife and I stepped away to discuss if we wanted to add the extra cost to our bill. At that time Chris called his manager and was told to let the tech deal with it because it was going to take 40 minutes.

We have been looking for a home security system and to turn our house into a smart house eventually. So we were pleased when Vivint showed up because the Vivint system is exactly both of those. He showed just before 8pm, which wasn’t ideal, but that’s a minor inconvenience. We built out a customized package for my house, but my wife was unsure due to the cost and needed to mull it over. So we asked the door to door sales guy if he could come back on Monday.A door to door salesman came to my house last weekend on a Saturday (5/9/20). We have been looking for a home security system and to turn our house into a smart house eventually. So we were pleased when Vivint showed up because the Vivint system is exactly both of those. He showed just before 8pm, which wasn’t ideal, but that’s a minor inconvenience. We built out a customized package for my house, but my wife was unsure due to the cost and needed to mull it over. So we asked the door to door sales guy if he could come back on Monday.I did some research for the wife and compared Vivint to other house systems like SimpliSafe, Ring, Nest, and Comcast. Of course there are much cheaper options, but I’m more of a person for quality. I’d rather spend a little extra to get something higher quality that will last. I was considering Nest as my go to system until the Vivint Rep showed up, and honestly for the equipment build out, the cost would be close in price for a Nest system and either I’d be stuck installing it, or pay a gross amount of money to have a Nest Pro come install it. The Vivint rep hooked me up with no activation fees and no installation fees and they installed everything that day. The only thing I paid for upfront was the first month of monitoring and equipment (read below for how equipment costs work into the monthly bill).Working in IT, I already know the vulnerabilities of WiFi based alarm systems like SimpliSafe, so I am not comfortable with those. If your ISP has a service interruption, or your modem goes down, or router goes down, or power goes out, or if you don’t have well configured WiFi security that can be hacked; then those WiFi based systems are extremely vulnerable. That means multiple points of failure. Granted those might be rare occurrences, but you only need it to happen once.I wanted a system with a cellular chip on its own network with a battery backup, and Vivint is exactly that, but it has a second chip for a second service provider as a secondary service connection backup too, plus they run a fully encrypted system to reduce the risk of getting hacked, which I thoroughly like. So if power goes out, my system won’t go down, or if Verizon cellular services go down, then the cellular chip will switch to AT&T service (or whatever cellular networks the chips connect to), that’s extremely comforting that my house will stay protected longer with less room for error. Another big pro for Vivint is, the company is entirely US based, and they don’t sell your information supposedly, so that’s very nice. They monitor everything here, make equipment here, and provide support from here in the US, no outsourced call centers!When it comes to equipment quality, I’ve had Ring previously and I feel like the picture quality of the doorbell is lacking, where Vivint is a full 4K quality system and much more clear. Other systems like Ring and Nest only have 3 year warranties on their products, Vivint is a lifetime warranty. So all of this encompassing really sold me on the system. There’s also another big perk for those who can’t afford expensive systems upfront, you don’t have to pay for all of the equipment upfront! You can pay for it in your monthly bill over the course of 5 years. So for those on a budget, it helps spread out that cost. I figured with 0% interest, you really can’t get a better option, so why not go ahead and do that. Once equipment is paid off, it’s yours and still retains that lifetime warranty, and it’s all still functional even if you disconnect service and don’t want your house monitored, so if you’re moving you can take it all with you! They set you up with autopay too starting day one, so you don’t even have to worry about remembering to pay your bill.Vivint has really stepped up to the plate and has taken out all of the difficulties involved with setting up a security system and converting your home into a smart home. Honestly, they’ve developed one heck of business model that eliminates all the problems and has a well developed, well rounded, completely guaranteed product that I am extremely impressed with.Worried about difficulty of use? The Vivint system isn’t too complicated to use. No more difficult than your smart phone honestly. So if you can utilize that well, you can manage the Vivint system. Vivint also connects into existing smart devices in your house, connect your lights with Z Wave switches, it connects with Nest thermostats, connects with echo dots or echo shows, connects to your smart phone and is fully controlled by your smart phone as well as whatever other smart devices you connected! Want a smart door lock? Yep, they have that too.So far I haven’t had any issues with the system, but then again I’m only on day 2. So you and I both might agree this review is premature. If anything goes wrong though, they do have a 30 day cancellation policy, so you can cut all service and have it all removed if you end up disliking the system. But I’m confident in the product so far. I’m happy with the purchase and think it will serve us well for years to come.','door door salesman came house last weekend saturday looking home security system turn house smart house eventually pleased vivint showed vivint system exactly showed pm ideal minor inconvenience built customized package house wife unsure due cost needed mull asked door door sales guy could come back monday door door salesman came house last weekend saturday looking home security system turn house smart house eventually pleased vivint showed vivint system exactly showed pm ideal minor inconvenience built customized package house wife unsure due cost needed mull asked door door sales guy could come back monday research wife compared vivint house systems like simplisafe ring nest comcast course much cheaper options person quality rather spend little extra get something higher quality last considering nest go system vivint rep showed honestly equipment build cost would close price nest system either stuck installing pay gross amount money nest pro come install vivint rep hooked activation fees installation fees installed everything day thing paid upfront first month monitoring equipment read equipment costs work monthly bill working already know vulnerabilities wifi based alarm systems like simplisafe comfortable isp service interruption modem goes router goes power goes well configured wifi security hacked wifi based systems extremely vulnerable means multiple points failure granted might rare occurrences need happen wanted system cellular chip network battery backup vivint exactly second chip second service provider secondary service connection backup plus run fully encrypted system reduce risk getting hacked thoroughly like power goes system go verizon cellular services go cellular chip switch service whatever cellular networks chips connect extremely comforting house stay protected longer less room error another big pro vivint company entirely us based sell information supposedly nice monitor everything make equipment provide support us outsourced call centers comes equipment quality ring feel like picture quality doorbell lacking vivint full k quality system much clear systems like ring nest year warranties products vivint lifetime warranty encompassing really sold system another big perk afford expensive systems upfront pay equipment upfront pay monthly bill course years budget helps spread cost figured interest really get better option go ahead equipment paid still retains lifetime warranty still functional even disconnect service want house monitored moving take set autopay starting day even worry remembering pay bill vivint really stepped plate taken difficulties involved setting security system converting home smart home honestly developed heck business model eliminates problems well developed well rounded completely guaranteed product extremely impressed worried difficulty use vivint system complicated use difficult smart phone honestly utilize well manage vivint system vivint connects existing smart devices house connect lights z wave switches connects nest thermostats connects echo dots echo shows connects smart phone fully controlled smart phone well whatever smart devices connected want smart door lock yep far issues system day might agree review premature anything goes wrong though day cancellation policy cut service removed end disliking system confident product far happy purchase think serve us well years come',0.212,0.681,0.108,0.9958)\n",

They seem as though they are waiting for something to come up so that they can drop the ball for someone else to pick up. Not so with Mr. **! He worked as if he was the owner of Vivint and knew that the impression that he made meant everything. Again, possessing superior product knowledge, Steve was able to further help my family by making sure our system fit our needs and not trying to sell additional items that would simply increase the cost. Steve actually made some adjustments and saved us money with a slightly lower payment than originally quoted. Not grudgingly, but rather genuinely happy to help. His expertise made set up a time saving breeze. In conclusion, my family thanks Brady, Devin, and Steve for being part of the solution. We''d also like to thank Mr. Todd Pedersen for being a leader that instills quality in his team by setting the example first.

He was really careful with everything and he was very good at explaining to me what he was doing while he was doing it. Everything in the service has been great. I noticed that a lot of people in my neighborhood have been upgrading to security cameras, but I haven''t really felt the need. I like the Vivint doorbell feature and that''s been great. All in all, once the system is on, I set it and I can turn it off. I certainly don''t think about it anymore. We get a lot of summer storms in Alberta and we had no power for 30 hours one time. Vivint called me on my cellphone and said, \"You know, your battery, you need to plug your system in.\" I said, \"Oh, can''t, sorry.\" And they were like, \"Oh, it''s been that long?\" And I said, \"Yeah, there''s nothing I can do about it.

There is the ability to check it out via phone and everything. But there are a lot of unfulfilled promises. There was a lot of stuff that I was told about the system that was not right and not true. The biggest thing was with the battery. Whenever we had a hurricane come through and we weren’t at home, our system would already be dead and we would call up Vivint.

There was a lot of stuff that I was told about the system that was not right and not true. The biggest thing was with the battery.

We were told that the batteries were there for a couple of hours as backup and not two days. But I was initially told that the backup battery for the system would last for three days. I''ve spoken with credible technicians that are both on the sales side, customer service and the actual installation technician. There was one girl that did the majority of the installation who was far from professional. She drilled holes in the wrong places of my doorframe. She said those were just little holes and that they were not a big deal. But it was my house and that was a big deal. And whenever she ran the wires in the attic to one of my cameras, she didn’t bother to wrap them along with the rafters and formers up there. She just threw the bundle up over like boxes of Christmas ornaments. We didn’t find that out until a few days later when I went up there to get stuff. With the front door, she didn’t chisel everything out properly and we were having problems with it or cracks with the door from her work.We had a lot of various serious problems. I finally got ahold of the regional manager. I told that this could be fixed today or tomorrow. Their people can come and leave all of their equipment in my house and put it back later. I also told the regional manager about the girl who did the installation and he told me not to worry. It would be taken care of and that he would send out his best technician. The stuff that was messed up was corrected and I appreciated that. The customer service in getting it fixed was immediate. I also have the garage door monitor which sometimes randomly stops working and that isn''t very helpful. But I like being able to look at and check out my house. We live down in Florida so whenever a hurricane comes here and we evacuate, we can check on our house. Overall, we''re happy with the system. It''s good. They are still some hiccups but I know that it''s still a relatively new technology. I have recommended Vivint to friends. I told them that if they are looking at alarms and cameras, they shouldn''t push Vivint out. They should at least look and see what they have once. It''s a technology that other companies don’t have.','liked vivint technology ability check via phone everything lot unfulfilled promises lot stuff told system right true biggest thing battery whenever hurricane come home system would already dead would call vivint told batteries couple hours backup days initially told backup battery system would last three days liked vivint technology ability check via phone everything lot unfulfilled promises lot stuff told system right true biggest thing battery whenever hurricane come home system would already dead would call vivint told batteries couple hours backup days initially told backup battery system would last three days spoken credible technicians sales side customer service actual installation technician girl majority installation far professional drilled holes wrong places doorframe said little holes big deal house big deal whenever ran wires attic cameras bother wrap along rafters formers threw bundle like boxes christmas ornaments find days later went get stuff front door chisel everything properly problems cracks door work lot various serious problems finally got ahold regional manager told could fixed today tomorrow come leave equipment house put back later told regional manager girl installation told worry would taken care would send best technician stuff messed corrected appreciated customer service getting fixed immediate garage door monitor sometimes randomly stops working helpful like able look check house live florida whenever hurricane comes evacuate check house overall happy system good still hiccups know still relatively technology recommended vivint friends told looking alarms cameras push vivint least look see technology companies',0.173,0.704,0.124,0.9371)\n",

I tested them then called in and they activated the account.I had every feature that I was looking for and more. The panel that they offered was easily the industry’s most feature-rich panel. They chose that for a reason because they wanted to be able to offer as much as they could to their customers. I could have a streaming video, I could have static sensors, and I could have outdoor cameras. I could have anything I wanted. They sold all that and they serviced it.

In terms of my purchasing experience and my customer service experience on the front end, it was great. The same can be said about the fact that Link is on the cellular system. That makes me feel good because it''s independent of power. Being away, it has a backup and it''s not a wire that''s gonna be cut. That''s why I went cellular versus a hard one.But I''m getting work done and one of the windows replaced so my system''s offline. When the sensors were being tweaked, they couldn''t sense this and that. Someone went through and adjusted some stuff. I told my son, \"They''re gonna be doing the work in here.

I upgraded to the Qolsys panel, motion sensors, and two cameras. I''ve used the Alarm.com snap lines, like a tripwire, for detecting intruders. There are some pretty neat features that you can take advantage of. But a big weakness is their seams. Seams are more for automation and partitions are more for safety.

When we call in, we immediately get directed to customer service and we don''t have to go through a huge automated system.When I first spoke with their sales department, the guy asked me what made me choose Link and what was I looking for. The main thing is that he wasn’t trying to use pressured sales to make me want to choose Link. He gave me my options, he broke down pricing, and he answered all my questions. He even gave me the option to call back later if I wanted to if I wasn’t sure. The installation went very smooth. I did a system takeover. I was already previously using at home a lot of my equipment and it took a little long install, but that was something I was already expecting because there was so much equipment I had before. But besides that, it was very easy and when I called in to activate, they were quick to do it. The last time I called their customer service, they went above and beyond to help with my issue. They forgot to send out a part to me accidentally and they overnighted it to me.Their system is very good quality. The equipment that I decided to go with was 2GIG, which is a company that’s been around for years, and I’m very happy with that. And the cost is extremely cheap. For the quality of service we receive for that, it''s a match. Not very many companies could go match what Link can do. Our sense of security has improved a lot from other companies. We arm the system when we''re home and when we go to work. We’re away from the house a lot. We always feel protected no matter what.','city live high crime rate main concern nice items rather stolen file thousands insurance claims replace different home security systems link customer service lot better companies service lot cheaper call immediately get directed customer service go huge automated system city live high crime rate main concern nice items rather stolen file thousands insurance claims replace different home security systems link customer service lot better companies service lot cheaper call immediately get directed customer service go huge automated system first spoke sales department guy asked made choose link looking main thing trying use pressured sales make want choose link gave options broke pricing answered questions even gave option call back later wanted sure installation went smooth system takeover already home lot equipment took little long install something already expecting much equipment besides easy called activate quick last time called customer service went beyond help issue forgot send part accidentally overnighted system good quality equipment decided go gig company around years happy cost extremely cheap quality service receive match many companies could go match link sense security improved lot companies arm system home go work away house lot always feel protected matter',0.199,0.712,0.089,0.9666)\n",

I''m supposed to feel safe knowing my security system is relying on 3M stickies lined up?) and their next solution was to use different sensors - ones that get drilled into the door and frame. I said no, that is not what I want to do, as that is not what I originally ordered and if I had known the only option for my doors was to now drill into my doors, I would never have ordered it.At that point, I had already paid for 4 months of service without using the service for even a day. I asked to cancel since this was not working in my house (and this was after trying their suggestions) and the refused. The only thing they offered was a discount on a buyout. So, fast forward to July 2020 and my service is just now ending, and I had to pay $30 a month for two years without ever using the service. They are 100% unwilling to work with you on canceling the service if it does not work for your home, and cling to contracts. I understand how contracts work, but as someone who works in the service industry, I have time and time again severed contracts if the relationship REALLY isn''t working. Why should both parties suffer? Link does not care - please know this before you sign up with them.

But it was a complete headache. It was to a point where I already got the contract and I knew I couldn’t get out of it. So I was like, “You know what, I’m just gonna pay you the money. I just pay you the monthly fee. Just leave me alone.” ADT sent me a thing that says you get a $100 gift card if you go through them. So I sent Link Interactive that and they went, “That’s not us.” They treated me like they didn''t really care how pissed I was since I had already locked in their contract. The person I bought the home from either had to pay an exit fee or I could just pick up the contract. But he did me so good and he is the only reason I stuck with Link Interactive. Otherwise, I would have ripped up the contract and they can deal with it themselves. The previous homeowner was like, “If you wanna take it over, here’s the contract.” I got the contract and the transfer form through email and we did that at closing. I did the transfer paperwork but I got nothing from Link. I contacted Link Interactive for five days and then I gave them a break. It was Friday and they were closed. I thought they probably wouldn''t be open until Monday. It said it would be assigned to somebody but it wasn’t or they never got back to me until we called them. It was the following Tuesday when I finally called them and I had a guy pretty much tell me to go online, go through the system and do it. The rep didn’t say it wasn’t his problem but it wasn’t his problem. It was assigned to somebody else who would be contacting with but they didn’t. I guess the previous owner was supposed to have done the other side of the transfer and he didn’t get to it or Link Interactive didn’t tell him to do it. It was like, “Well, we can’t do anything ''til he signs this.” We asked if Link was gonna contact the previous owner but we never really got answers. So I called the previous owner and he was like, “Oh, I’ll do it right now.” He ended up sending over the authorization. So I thought that was good. But Link Interactive went back and forth with me. I couldn''t even get the system on the internet. They kept telling me to leave it on so I did but they had no way to communicate with it because it’s not a cellphone service. I think it goes through the internet. But I can’t hook it up through the internet because they won’t give me any passwords to do it. My wife talked to Connor yesterday at Link Interactive and he was absolutely amazing. She''s happy with him. We were able to arm the system last night to go to bed and then when we left this morning, we armed it. It’s all up and running now but there’s still one thing missing. There’s a malfunction somewhere and they keep saying, “Well, it should be near an adjacent wall.” But that sensor is saying it’s in the master room, which is on the opposite side of the house. They sent us a picture but we have no clue where it’s at. They didn’t send the tech out. I don’t even know if they’re only internet people and they have no representatives that come out. I’d love to see somebody come out but I made it perfectly clear that I didn''t have a clue what I was doing and nobody ever said, “You know what, we’ll just send somebody out there and make it a lot easier for you.” It’s like we’re trying to figure out how to use the system ourselves although Link Interactive sent my wife a little booklet so we have at least a digital copy of that. In fact, yesterday, when Connor asked what else he could do, my wife was like, “Can you tell me how to arm it? ‘Cause I don’t even know how to arm the system or shut it off.”','started link interactive th yesterday first day could actually arm system blaming alarm com taking long alarm com issue even know deal since probably st daily activity trying get get things taken care even talking gave credit card number charged yet give said charge st got system working last night charged today probably saying complete headache started link interactive th yesterday first day could actually arm system blaming alarm com taking long alarm com issue even know deal since probably st daily activity trying get get things taken care even talking gave credit card number charged yet give said charge st got system working last night charged today probably saying complete headache point already got contract knew get like know gonna pay money pay monthly fee leave alone adt sent thing says get gift card go sent link interactive went us treated like really care pissed since already locked contract person bought home either pay exit fee could pick contract good reason stuck link interactive otherwise would ripped contract deal previous homeowner like wanna take contract got contract transfer form email closing transfer paperwork got nothing link contacted link interactive five days gave break friday closed thought probably open monday said would assigned somebody never got back called following tuesday finally called guy pretty much tell go online go system rep say problem problem assigned somebody else would contacting guess previous owner supposed done side transfer get link interactive tell like well anything til signs asked link gonna contact previous owner never really got answers called previous owner like oh right ended sending authorization thought good link interactive went back forth even get system internet kept telling leave way communicate cellphone service think goes internet hook internet give passwords wife talked connor yesterday link interactive absolutely amazing happy able arm system last night go bed left morning armed running still thing missing malfunction somewhere keep saying well near adjacent wall sensor saying master room opposite side house sent us picture clue send tech even know internet representatives come love see somebody come made perfectly clear clue nobody ever said know send somebody make lot easier like trying figure use system although link interactive sent wife little booklet least digital copy fact yesterday connor asked else could wife like tell arm cause even know arm system shut',0.16,0.74,0.1,0.9852)\n",

In the beginning, I also had something that I needed to fix on my end where the alarm was beeping when I was in the office. I clicked on something that made it do that and they helped me to correct that. The quality of the system is good. I like it.','everything good link interactive system thing issue strips strips secure held like said however long seemed pretty sturdy days came hanging pretty low beginning something needed fix end alarm beeping office clicked something made helped correct quality system good like everything good link interactive system thing issue strips strips secure held like said however long seemed pretty sturdy days came hanging pretty low beginning something needed fix end alarm beeping office clicked something made helped correct quality system good like',0.356,0.563,0.082,0.9821)\n",

It takes a little bit more than that. Link Interactive is based in Utah and they didn''t wanna come down to Florida to take my hand and show me how to install it. So they did it over the phone and I suppose that''s conducive to most of their clients. Link Interactive should give better, both verbal and written, instructions. All computer programmers do it because they''re thinking of it all the time. Questions that might arise to the average person don''t come across in Link''s mind, so they don''t make provisions for it. And it''s only when people report back that they find where the loopholes are.The security system is excellent. I like the fact that you can use your key remotes which are excellent. Say my wife, who maybe has a eyesight problem, and you''re going to put a code in on a dark night on the door, it could be a little bit difficult.

I had ordered the outdoor camera, the thermostat, and the garage door, and she sent the front door lock by accident. I called them and a guy helped me, and we got it rectified. So, the service has been excellent still. And the quality of the equipment is high. I did the installation myself and it was easy. I set up the camera but I haven''t looked at the directions when I did the thermostat so that might be a different piece. Then, my camera just arrived, but I''ve had Link for 2 months now.

I’m still not able to pair it with my Z-Wave locks, which I have already installed in the house. I tried contacting Link Interactive a couple of times, but I’m not getting a concrete answer whether these are incompatible with their system. Because with the other service provider, they have that one and it’s working great. So, we''re not able to move out from the other service provider, because the systems are not able to communicate with the Link Interactive module.I have a self-monitoring system. I have the Nexia, which automates all my doors and locks, which works on a different technology. I have several locks and they are all automated. The system has the light controls too, the motion detectors, fire detection and water leakage detector. There is also something called a Z-Wave technology. It is like a common technology platform connected to all these devices. In fact, my Alexa is also connected through that. So, if I ask Alexa to do something, I can just talk to the Alexa. My self-monitoring system do more than Link Interactive. I have several different people, like the cleaner. He comes in the house and I have created his account so he can open certain locks and he can actually get inside the house and do the cleaning, which is next to impossible in the Link Interactive, because it’s all connected in the home automation system. So, that’s one of the issues, because I’m not able to move forward from my old to the new platform because it really doesn’t cope up. It doesn’t connect.Also, there is something called a multi-user interaction. So, in the Nexia, I can create up to 10 people with different code numbers. So, 10 people can be allowed into the home and they can use their own codes, and I can customize their access. So, I don’t give the access to the cleaner to get into the garage because the garage does not require the cleaning, so he cannot actually go into the garage. But he can go to the other rooms for the cleaning stuff. There is also something like the guest mode, so that means I can remotely open my doors. If any guest comes into my home and I don’t want to give them any code number or anything, I can just open the locks remotely through anywhere.When I got the Link Interactive, they told me that it is going to be compatible with those. But I’m not even able to pair any of them as of now. Link Interactive security system is like an old school. It just have a magnetic something. So, I have not moved on to the Link Interactive as of now. I told them, “This is all what I want you to move from the old one to the new one because then I can save some money.” Otherwise, there is no point of having two different things. So, my old system takes care of the door locks. But if I put my security system on the alarm, on the active mode, even though if the authorized user enter the home, it will actually switch on the alarm because it doesn’t understand.These are third-party modules, but till this time, it has not been paired. I cannot even go into the other option to see what capability Link Interactive is providing me till the time that it’s not even paired any one of the locks. So, that’s where the problem is. It’s not able to even pair with the Link Interactive system. I wanna see who is the other service provider who can actually accommodate all of my current system and take it over rather than I have to really move it. The system didn''t work the first time. I was at work then, probably like midnight. I worked with them, and they were telling me that something is wrong with my system. Ultimately, they found that something is wrong with their configuration and they had to sort it out. So, my first impression was like, “Okay. So, you sent me something which was not configured properly,” even though I gave them all the information, what they requested me to take over the entire system, what I have currently. But they misconfigured the system, so it didn''t work at all. It was showing different messages, which is not even there. For an example, “The battery is poor,” and there was no battery involved in the entire system. But I can say that the support was good. They were with me for several hours, but they found out that the issue is from their side, not from my side.Furthermore, they do not have the professional installment, just do it yourself. So, even though I can say it’s not complicated, but because they were telling me that something is wrong with my system, I had to really spend a lot of time. It took time for them to understand, “Oh, this is not my system. This is their system,” but in order to get into that point, I had to do so many things, so many changes. I literally spent lost time, what I was not supposed to spend. If they had sent out professionals to install that system, then they would have the entire control of the configuration, they’d know exactly what I’m trying to tell them. It’d be a different experience altogether when someone professionally comes out to your door and completes the stuff versus you’re trying to figure it out, whether you did it right or I did wrong. And there was a time when they were saying “No, I think there is something wrong with your old system and we really cannot work with your old system.” So, even though they told me that it’s a DIY and that it’s very simple, and that they''ll tell me step-by-step how to do things, but because their configuration was set up wrong, their system cannot understand whether it is right because their configuration was wrong in their side. And then they reprogrammed it. Once they reprogrammed it, everything started working.','link interactive adding normal capability right still able pair z wave locks already installed house tried contacting link interactive couple times getting concrete answer whether incompatible system service provider working great able move service provider systems able communicate link interactive module link interactive adding normal capability right still able pair z wave locks already installed house tried contacting link interactive couple times getting concrete answer whether incompatible system service provider working great able move service provider systems able communicate link interactive module self monitoring system nexia automates doors locks works different technology several locks automated system light controls motion detectors fire detection water leakage detector something called z wave technology like common technology platform connected devices fact alexa connected ask alexa something talk alexa self monitoring system link interactive several different like cleaner comes house created account open certain locks actually get inside house cleaning next impossible link interactive connected home automation system issues able move forward old platform really cope connect something called multi user interaction nexia create different code numbers allowed home use codes customize access give access cleaner get garage garage require cleaning cannot actually go garage go rooms cleaning stuff something like guest mode means remotely open doors guest comes home want give code number anything open locks remotely anywhere got link interactive told going compatible even able pair link interactive security system like old school magnetic something moved link interactive told want move old save money otherwise point different things old system takes care door locks put security system alarm active mode even though authorized user enter home actually switch alarm understand third party modules till time paired cannot even go option see capability link interactive providing till time even paired locks problem able even pair link interactive system wanna see service provider actually accommodate current system take rather really move system work first time work probably like midnight worked telling something wrong system ultimately found something wrong configuration sort first impression like okay sent something configured properly even though gave information requested take entire system currently misconfigured system work showing different messages even example battery poor battery involved entire system say support good several hours found issue side side furthermore professional installment even though say complicated telling something wrong system really spend lot time took time understand oh system system order get point many things many changes literally spent lost time supposed spend sent professionals install system would entire control configuration know exactly trying tell different experience altogether someone professionally comes door completes stuff versus trying figure whether right wrong time saying think something wrong old system really cannot work old system even though told diy simple tell step step things configuration set wrong system cannot understand whether right configuration wrong side reprogrammed reprogrammed everything started working',0.12,0.81,0.071,0.9565)\n",

I did it myself and their reps were able to help me with it. I haven’t had the patience to deal with the cameras and running the wire for that bit. I have a brick home, so it''s not the easiest. But the rest of the system was very easy to do. I dealt with the same person from point of contact for price and products inquiry going all the way through sales and the delivery, so I was really impressed with that. The Link Interactive guy was willing to share with me what he knew so we communicated through email easily. He made it a very simple process for something as complicated as what I ended up getting. He did a very good job and I was very impressed with him.

But the rest of the system was very easy to do. The system is good and accurate, and their pricing definitely beat the four companies I was quoting through. Also, those companies didn’t have the quality of service so the quality of service is the big deciding factor for me. I’ve been really happy with Link Interactive. I’ve got multiple users on it. One thing I was really concerned about with some of the competitors was being able to have a number of users with restricted access. I have teenage daughters, so that helps with that process. I don’t want them going on being able to see what was going on with the cameras. So they’re not able to. I was able to differentiate that.

And they decided to stop their business, so I compared several companies and chose Link Interactive for the IQ2 panel. It is a touch panel that I liked. But the previous system that I had was far superior. Other than that, Link''s sales and customer service representatives were very good. They helped and did very well.A lot of Link''s sensors and cameras are based on alarm.com. And the cameras are horrible because you have to buy. I bought seven cameras because if your home wouldn''t pair, they just don''t pair. And then, I got two panels from Link. I looked at their homepage, what kind of accessories the panel supports, what sensors, what cameras, what model, and I ordered stuff on eBay for that system. And when the system came, it wouldn''t pair. They told me they had sent me a panel with an older or different system linked to it. It was not according to their homepage. They took the panel back, and sent me a new one. So, the initial set-up was a little bit bumpy. But when it comes to setting up sensors, pairing sensors, that works quickly.In the older system I had before, they had the key fob. The system would detect when you arrive at the house. By itself, it would turn it off and on. The current one here has manual ones, which is to press the button. The old system had the functionality to turn the system on and off at a certain time you programmed it. But for Link, I have to pay extra for that, which I refused to do.And one thing that''s misleading is the geofencing. I understood that you have cellphones linked to your account and when the system sees when the cellphone is not in the house, it will then do something. It can turn the light off and it can turn the temperature oven down, but it cannot arm the alarm system. That is something so simple to add there. For me, it''s not a big thing, but my wife forgets a lot to arm or disarm. We were used in the past that when the vehicle arrives with the key fobs in it, the system would disarm automatically. We didn''t have to worry, \"Oh, we forgot it.\" Here at Link, it''s not possible. They send you a text message saying, \"Oh, by the way, you forgot to arm your system.\" That''s what the geofencing does. But that''s not state-of-the-art.Also, Link''s system is too expensive. The Iris Lowe''s system had a monthly charge of $15. I had 18 cameras on the system. The geofencing was not available, but they had the key fobs which were detected by the system. There is a lot of functionality to program in with different rules and scenes to say, \"Well, if the key fob arrives, not by 4:00 then please send a text message to the parent.\" Let''s say if your daughter doesn''t show up at 4:00 after school, you get a notification. Link is below that level. They don''t have that, and I''m paying $35. So, I''m paying more than double for less functionality. Each four cameras is another $5. So, if I add 20 cameras to it, I''m having a 56-dollar system. That is outrageous. So, I only have four cameras with Link and 15 other ones with different companies. I had to split up because I didn''t wanna pay extra. Plus, the exterior cameras do not have interactions. In the Iris system, if the camera detects movement, it turns on the light. The Link does not. Link can do an alarm or not, but they do not turn the light on with the camera sensor. So, you have to buy another extra motion sensor next to it that would do that. Moreover, Link has no support on Sundays, which is unacceptable too. I''m paying more than double than what I had before, so I expect a better service. But that''s not the case. Still, I''m satisfied with Link.','system lowe called iris years decided stop business compared several companies chose link interactive iq panel touch panel liked previous system far superior link sales customer service representatives good helped well system lowe called iris years decided stop business compared several companies chose link interactive iq panel touch panel liked previous system far superior link sales customer service representatives good helped well lot link sensors cameras based alarm com cameras horrible buy bought seven cameras home pair pair got panels link looked homepage kind accessories panel supports sensors cameras model ordered stuff ebay system system came pair told sent panel older different system linked according homepage took panel back sent initial set little bit bumpy comes setting sensors pairing sensors works quickly older system key fob system would detect arrive house would turn current manual ones press button old system functionality turn system certain time programmed link pay extra refused thing misleading geofencing understood cellphones linked account system sees cellphone house something turn light turn temperature oven cannot arm alarm system something simple add big thing wife forgets lot arm disarm used past vehicle arrives key fobs system would disarm automatically worry oh forgot link possible send text message saying oh way forgot arm system geofencing state art link system expensive iris lowe system monthly charge cameras system geofencing available key fobs detected system lot functionality program different rules scenes say well key fob arrives please send text message parent let say daughter school get notification link level paying paying double less functionality four cameras another add cameras dollar system outrageous four cameras link ones different companies split wanna pay extra plus exterior cameras interactions iris system camera detects movement turns light link link alarm turn light camera sensor buy another extra motion sensor next would moreover link support sundays unacceptable paying double expect better service case still satisfied link',0.14,0.778,0.082,0.9561)\n",

If an emergency happens, the speaker that the operator speaks to you through is unbelievably loud. You wanna stay away from it, but you also have to communicate with it. It’s already stressful when the alarm is going off, and you try and enter your code. And then the kids are crying because the alarm went off, and then this really loud speaker goes off, and you’re trying to communicate. They’re so loud, I can’t even think straight.

I had to do it though and I was essentially pulling out a match or a candle trying to get the smoke in there for the smoke sensor to set off. Then, I put the sensor in a refrigerator to make it cold and put it in water and other things. I also used the hairdryer for one of the sensors. In the end, testing of those sensors wasn’t that bad.

When I contacted Guardian, he wasn''t working there anymore. But I had some new stuff put in because my smoke detector wasn’t hooked up to the system and it kept beeping. I’ve got vaulted ceilings here and it’s right at the top. I’d had to get a ladder that was 15-foot tall in order to get up there. And I had changed it once, a couple years ago, but a little bit younger then and I did not feel like climbing up ladders. So, I had called Guardian, had them put in a new smoke detector which is hooked up to my panel, and it’s at a place where if the battery needs to be changed, I can just get on a stool and take it off.But they also put in a carbon dioxide checker too. And they put that where if there was carbon monoxide in the house from my heater or something, it would show up. And I’ve never had a problem with carbon monoxide, but you cannot take a chance. So, I had them put it in. It was expensive, but I could afford it. I knew it was gonna cost me because they told me ahead of time what it was gonna cost, which was okay. When they put the system in, they didn’t charge me anything. It was one of those advertisement things where they come around all the time. All you have to do is pay the first payments and that is it, which is fine.So, now, if something happens where I got smoke and it sets the alarm off, I can go to the panel and put my code in and have the thing shut off because I have had smoke in here one time. I had oil in a cast-iron frying pan and I was curing it, so I had it on fire under it. And I forgot about it and went to the bedroom, and I was talking to my wife. So, all of a sudden, the siren goes off and I came running in there and the house was full of smoke. I then went ahead and opened the doors and everything else and tried to shut the thing off. It took me a couple of times before there was no smoke. I called up Protection 1 and told them, “I just had a little problem with smoke on my stove.” My wife said, “Everything’s taken care of. Please, don’t send anybody out.” The fire department come over, however, and parked out in front of my house, and I told them what happened. Overall, Guardian has been good. If I’ve had something wrong, they’d come out and fix it.  Also, the guy who did the installation did a good job and he took care of business.

And if they realized they had it, they would probably want it. But other than that, it was a very professional, polite, and pleasant interaction. I am in a wheelchair, and I have mobility and physical issues, and I also have hearing problems. I like the fact that I can take the panel from room to room with me and have it at hand where I can deal with it instead of having it up. The system I had before was on the wall and I had to stand up out of my wheelchair and reach above me to use it, which was quite inconvenient. But with Guardian, it''s wherever I need it to be. I can also do the same way with the strobe and siren system, which is a little plug-in thing that goes into the wall like your system. The other system that I had would announce whenever there was a tornado warning for my particular area. There was a kind of a beeping tone that would come across to let me know, and a message that appeared on the screen that there was a tornado within my area. I needed to be aware of that as a safety feature. I do miss that and I wish Guardian does that too. Also, I really wish there was a manual that came with it. I have a great deal of difficulty figuring things out by guess and by gosh, and I''m very good with electronics. I wish it was a small six-page pamphlet that explains, \"If you want to do this, this is how you do it or this is what this feature is,\" type thing.The strobe light makes me feel very much more secure. I have a feeling that several times people come to my door and I don''t even know they''re there. I have had a few times when people have tried to deliver packages and I''ve had to call them to come back two or three times and told them they have to call me and let me know that they were at the door because I would not come to pick up the package because I wouldn''t know they were at my door. That was a little bit scary.The tech set up the system in the main room, so it''s where it is most of the time, but when I go to bed at night, I take the strobe and the pad in my room with me as well as I have a wristband. He also was able to hook it up to go through by telephone and internet. With the other system I had before, I had a wired house internet. They couldn''t put that through which didn''t make much sense to me. So now, I feel much better because I''ve got this band that''s on my wrist that I can take with me. I can access it with my cellphone as well as I can move the pad around where I am.I had fallen twice in my house when I had the other system. I had really stumbled and my footing ran away from me and I ended up sitting on the floor, and I couldn''t get back up. I had to crawl to my cellphone because I couldn''t even reach the security pad since I had to stand up to hit it to make it go off. But with Guardian, I feel much more secure that I''ve got enough systems if that happened again.','guardian much superior provider used past tech seemed capable needed strobe put hearing problem done sat figured got fine order strobe light come back second day carry happen live town lot elderly disabled well state school deaf given demographics would use strobe light realized would probably want professional polite pleasant interaction guardian much superior provider used past tech seemed capable needed strobe put hearing problem done sat figured got fine order strobe light come back second day carry happen live town lot elderly disabled well state school deaf given demographics would use strobe light realized would probably want professional polite pleasant interaction wheelchair mobility physical issues hearing problems like fact take panel room room hand deal instead system wall stand wheelchair reach use quite inconvenient guardian wherever need way strobe siren system little plug thing goes wall like system system would announce whenever tornado warning particular area kind beeping tone would come across let know message appeared screen tornado within area needed aware safety feature miss wish guardian really wish manual came great deal difficulty figuring things guess gosh good electronics wish small six page pamphlet explains want feature type thing strobe light makes feel much secure feeling several times come door even know times tried deliver packages call come back three times told call let know door would come pick package know door little bit scary tech set system main room time go bed night take strobe pad room well wristband able hook go telephone internet system wired house internet put make much sense feel much better got band wrist take access cellphone well move pad around fallen twice house system really stumbled footing ran away ended sitting floor get back crawl cellphone even reach security pad since stand hit make go guardian feel much secure got enough systems happened',0.217,0.72,0.063,0.993)\n",

Somebody could break in. If they got in through the door or the window that would set it off. But we moved around a lot in here when the motion detector really didn''t notice it. That gives me some cause for concern. If we would open a window, the alarm sounds. We''re aware of it. So, everything else seems to be working fine. I know that if somebody broke into the house that the system would go off at the door or at the window. I''m just not fully satisfied with the fact that sometimes, it does take the motion detector a while to pick up some movements. In fact, last Sunday, I came downstairs and I came into the kitchen. I know it doesn''t get the whole kitchen, but it should get me going back and forth like between my refrigerator and my sink. I moved around two or three times before the thing went off which scared the daylights out of me because I realized I forgot to turn it off. But I was thinking, I was really moving around in here and that thing never went off.

What do you want to call this window?” Now I know exactly. So when it goes off, I know what it’s saying. I know where the location is. They’re really good about that. And I had a water devise. Guardian normally don’t have it but there’s one and they programmed it in for me. So far, I got every window and every door protected in my house. I love their smartphone app. Last night, I went to bed and remembered I didn’t set the alarm. I didn’t have to get up. I just picked up my phone and made sure I set it.

The guy that came in to do it  was really professional and he was in and out quick. The only issue I''ve had was with the motion detector in my living room. It just was going off for no reason and we couldn''t figure out why. So, they ended up moving it away from the heat vent figuring that maybe something was being blown in front of it. That didn''t fix the problem, so they came back again and put a meter on it and found that there was something in there that was draining the battery. And when I got a low battery, it was sounding the alarm. It was a minor issue, but I wish they had put the meter on and checked that the first time that they came out. It went on for a couple of weeks. When it went off once, they came out to check and then moved it, and then it was fine for a week. And then it went off three times in four days. And I said, \"This can''t go on, you guys gotta come back,\" and that was when they replaced it, and it has been fine since then.The other issue I had was with smoke detectors. I got this new generation of smoke detector that has a 10-year battery in it, so you don''t replace them until you replace the smoke detectors. So, it went off one Saturday morning for no reason. Nobody was cooking in the house. So, they came out and they checked it, and the guy told me that there was a recall on the date codes that I had installed. So, he replaced all three of the smoke detectors in the house. But about a week later, another one went off, and they found that that was the same issue as the motion sensors. It was draining the battery, so they had to replace that. So far, the people have been very nice and very easy to deal with.

But the camera itself may be defective because I have two cameras, one is working but the other one is not working.Having the Guardian Protection system is better for me because I''m a dual residence from New York and Delaware so it definitely gives me a peace of mind that when I''m not in Delaware, that I''m able to at least see the front of the house, the doorbell camera and monitor my packages. Then from my phone, I can open the garage and have a neighbor put it in there. It''s really a cool feature that I like.','cameras working technician guardian tried troubleshoot much could rear camera would connect said something internet permanent hookup yet covid verizon temporary lines nothing grounded technician told give call back finished everything verizon would come cameras camera may defective cameras working working cameras working technician guardian tried troubleshoot much could rear camera would connect said something internet permanent hookup yet covid verizon temporary lines nothing grounded technician told give call back finished everything verizon would come cameras camera may defective cameras working working guardian protection system better dual residence york delaware definitely gives peace mind delaware able least see front house doorbell camera monitor packages phone open garage neighbor put really cool feature like',0.141,0.813,0.045,0.8822)\n",

They sent something through an email, but I couldn''t access it ‘cause I couldn''t print it out. There were so many pages and I don’t have a printer at home. Then I had Bose speakers installed when the house was built. There were four different stations in my house, so four different units that I had set up, and I could control it through an app on the phone. It worked for a few months then it went out. I called Guardian. The guy came out, spent a couple of hours fixing it and got it back up working. A couple of months later, it went out again. The guy came out and he was instructed to send it back to the company. Then it took about five months before they called to bring it back. They reinstalled it and it worked for two or three months.The speakers went out again. By this time, I’m not even used to having it, and these things were expensive. The guy came out and tried to fix it but he wasn''t able to. Then they called and said that they would send it back to the company again. It was gone for a few more months. This last guy who came back out to install it said that it didn’t make sense if all the units went out at one time since they all have separate wiring. He traced it back to the box. There''s a switch there that goes on and off and he said that there''s something wrong with that. He redid all the wiring. The units are working right now, but he suggested that they come out and exchange that panel that has the switches. He gave it a different name to something that he thought would work better because obviously, the problem is coming from one place. He checked everything and said that they would call me within a few days. Well, that’s been over a week and nobody’s called to set up an appointment to come out and check that. Probably within another month or two, the units will go out again, and at some point, they''re gonna say that I have to pay for it and these haven''t worked. I’ve gotten probably less than seven months’ use out of these things total, and I’ve been here almost two years. Then some of my friends are now building retirement homes and they have Guardian in them. If they''re in here and they hear the speakers are great, they''ll ask if I would recommend that, I''d say no. I have shut down a number of people that were planning on getting this system.The people that came out here from Guardian seemed to really wanna solve the problem, except for this last guy. He seemed to see something different that actually made sense to me, but yet, they haven''t called to make an appointment to come do what his suggestion was. I’d still like to use the system. I’ve been paying for it for the protection, ‘cause I don’t want another company. It''s already wired for Guardian. All I want is to have a pamphlet or some booklet they could send me.

My husband ended up researching and fixing the issue but Guardian finds it acceptable to have my garage door open to public for 48 hours.This was nothing compared to the fire alarm not working a week later. Our carbon monoxide detectors went off this past Saturday evening but luckily for me, I just had Guardian install an alarm that was supposed to call the fire department if the fire or carbon monoxide detectors went off. False, they surprise didn’t do the job right. I had to call three times to finally get ahold of someone to call the fire department. It’s 35 degrees outside with a four-year-old and small dog. Now the earliest appointment I can get to fix this issue is a week and a half away. The kicker is I called to speak to a manager and was basically told, “well what do you want me to do about it?” Let’s see, first off an apology for the series of events would be great. Then try some real customer service.','numerous issues guardian several encounters started first service technician equipment requested refused connect garage door account told call customer service needed called customer service told tech needed work numerous issues guardian several encounters started first service technician equipment requested refused connect garage door account told call customer service needed called customer service told tech needed work second appointment scheduled install device missing first visit garage door appointment scheduled thursday called pm told technician running late would early evening called back told actually appointment despite received confirmation email voicemail earlier week appointment rescheduled saturday morning technician came installed fire alarm got garage doors working thought although tech tested garage addition phone test panel car clickers left went leave house discovered could shut garage door none devices working called back told tech might time come back probably monday husband ended researching fixing issue guardian finds acceptable garage door open public hours nothing compared fire alarm working week later carbon monoxide detectors went past saturday evening luckily guardian install alarm supposed call fire department fire carbon monoxide detectors went false surprise job right call three times finally get ahold someone call fire department degrees outside four year old small dog earliest appointment get fix issue week half away kicker called speak manager basically told well want let see first apology series events would great try real customer service',0.082,0.828,0.089,-0.1847)\n",

The first communication with your representative informed that I did not have monitoring service rendered by Guardian Protection Services since May 17, 2019 and that no notification to the fire department occurred September 11, 2019 from their entity.This scenario of disconnection of monitoring service for the mentioned property is misleading as there have been constant month on month billing for security services since May 2019 to date and the representative informed that all month on month billing since May 2019 has been paid. She then proceed to say billing was TURNED on in error. I asserted that this is not an error as this misleads me to believe I had coverage and monitoring services. No notices were sent that I needed to reinstate service, apply for a new contract, or refunds for payments as monitoring service was discontinued.The billing without coverage/monitoring/ service is misleading in that there is an account number associated with the billing each month. I received billing in the form of mail and email. I can access Guardian Protection Services website account billing to pay for services according to billing notifications. Therefore, no error has been performed but false representation of services and misleading a consumer in unfair practices. This practice of billing lasted for months and there is no indication that this would have stopped or I ,the consumer, would have been notified of this issue, refund issued, or clear communication to reinstate services is necessary.I have asked that this matter be escalated for arbitration with Guardian and have received coercing e-mails/ communications threatening to cut off services that were not instated properly since May 2019. Guardian refuses to address the evidence of their negligence even when they requested to see reports of the fire. Now all my calls have to go through A credit manager and she has not addressed any of my concerns and acts as an agent to issue out ultimatum communications of ceasing services (that are not instated since May 2019 due to Guardian negligence) and that billing was not applied after I reported this negligence. However, Guardian Protection Services continued to bill me from Sept. 2019 - Dec. 2019.Over the past months, I have continued to receive mistreatment from Guardian with the latest regarding being kept from a legible copy of my contract signed. They informed me that the Loyalty Department can explain the contract, but not provide me a clear copy.

I only found this out when I canceled my telephone service MONTHS ago and just got a call that they aren''t receiving anything from our alarm system. I go through the paperwork and neither box was checked on for where it states I must have a landline or cellphone line to use the system. Call guardian up and the representative told me that it says it on his copy and that my carbon copy must have “erased” off of it, yet everything else is clearly on their and not removed. Secondly I had a technician come out since they were not receiving any type of signal from our system and the tech tells me that our alarm system is discontinued and will need replaced for the cost of $620 plus installation fees but for today only they will waive installation fees. This is absolutely ridiculous. So I asked to back out of my contract because I have been dissatisfied for awhile because of the contract being so long and now it''s all this money to replace a system I am paying monthly on...so when asked to cancel they tell me i must pay over $1200 to cancel my service...
